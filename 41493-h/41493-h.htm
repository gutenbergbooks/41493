<h3 class="chap1">THE LEWIS AND CLARK CENTENNIAL.<br />

<span class="s08">THE OCCASION AND ITS OBSERVANCE.</span></h3>

<p>Much that seems favorable, and not a little that is
clearly unfavorable, has come to the Lewis and Clark
Centennial because its date is just a year later than that
of the Louisiana Purchase Centennial. A striking advantage
in this close succession is, however, still to be used.
It is the idea of a centennial at Portland in the Columbia
Valley in the very next year following one at Saint Louis
on the Mississippi that needs to be exploited. In this
close succession of these two centennials of the access of
the American nationality to regions of which one lies far
beyond the other we have the key to the fullest interpretation
of the national significance of the anniversary of
the Lewis and Clark expedition. Nothing else could so
tellingly exhibit the basis for a peculiar national interest
in our anniversary as the fact that it is virtually contemporary
with that to be observed at Saint Louis. The
purchase of Louisiana bears practically the same natal
relation to the western half of the Mississippi Valley that
the Lewis and Clark expedition does to the Pacific Northwest.
This the average American citizen no doubt finds
it hard to realize. Oregon, however, can boast age over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
the other commonwealths west of the Mississippi, excepting
only Missouri and Iowa and they are barely older.</p>

<p>The western half of the Mississippi Valley has far outstripped
us in material development. Nevertheless, considering
the conditions of isolation under which the people
of Oregon have labored they can be justly proud of
the progress that has been made here in all lines of endeavor.
Saint Louis will be justified in vaunting in 1904
the achievements and results of a century of development
in the region of which she is the metropolis; but
Portland, as the metropolis of the Pacific Northwest,
would have been culpably derelict if she had not undertaken
an observance of the centennial of the Lewis and
Clark expedition that shall emphasize to the nation and
to the world the significance of the occupation of the
Pacific coast by the American people, and to foster the
aspirations of one of the most favored sections on the
face of the earth. The basis of our claim to a national
recognition of our anniversary is something more solid
than the fact that we have added what we have to the
material strength of the nation. The secret of the unparalleled
effort that Oregon proposes to make for the
observance of the Lewis and Clark centennial lies deeper
than a mere feeling of exultation over material development
and the hope of advertising our resources to the
world.</p>

<p>The Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition has clearly
two unique and complementary missions. It should bring
fully into the national consciousness the historic services
through which this nation attained an outlook upon the
Pacific comparable with that on the Atlantic, and the
significance of this to the future of the American people.
It should address itself to the peculiar problems of progress
on this coast and thus mark an epoch in the added
impetus, the better organization, and the higher aims it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
gives us as a people; rightly planned it would be an exposition
of patriotic national services and of the problems
of largest social progress&mdash;an exposition of western history
and western problems.</p>

<p>The Lewis and Clark expedition and the Oregon movement,
or the American movement to the Pacific, which
the Lewis and Clark expedition initiated, have not yet
had anything like an adequate interpretation in American
history. Oregon represents the greatest opportunity in
our national life&mdash;an opportunity that the fathers of Oregon
made as well as seized. A sequel to the Oregon opportunity,
or rather a part of it, were the immense gains
south of the forty-second parallel on the Pacific Slope.
Through the Oregon opportunity realized this American
democracy has a territorial basis for supremacy among
the nations of the world, and this nation and all mankind
will profit from it to the end of time. The Louisiana Purchase
was not an opportunity made, but only one accepted
when it was tossed into the nation's lap. The Oregon
opportunity, as it stands in history and in promise for the
future&mdash;in what is realized and in what is only potential&mdash;is
in its import only second to the American opportunity.
It had to do with the winning of a domain that
made our nation four-square and continental, with a national
territory commensurate with the spirit and possibilities
of the American people.</p>

<p>The development of the situation on this coast, which
the Lewis and Clark expedition converted into America's
opportunity, was something like this: Four hundred
years ago this continent lay unoccupied save by a race destined
to melt away before the onslaughts of the sturdier
European. The Spaniard, schooled by eight centuries
of crusading against the Moor, whom he had finally
driven from Spanish soil, was in the moment of victory,
when his hands were free and spirit exultant, pointed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Columbus the supposed way to the Indies, long-famed for
unparalleled riches. Spanish hopes were high and the
cavaliers came on.</p>

<p>They passed by the West Indies in quest of gold. Cortes
and Pizarro found something of their hearts' desire in
Mexico and Peru. So on they pressed down the west
coast of South America and up the west coast of North
America and across the Pacific; but the vigor of the
Spaniard was about wasted. He hung helplessly to his
outposts on the flanks of the Pacific Northwest. At the
beginning of the last quarter of the eighteenth century he
rallied and sent vessels up and down the coast of Oregon;
but his explorations were not determinate, and they were
not followed by occupation. Early in the eighteenth century
the Muscovite, advancing eastward across Siberia,
had reached the shores of the Pacific, and soon gained a
foothold on our northern shores, with designs on all this
coast. England, too, was ready to have a hand in the contest
for this last great territorial prize on the North American
continent. Elated by her decisive victories over her
mortal enemy, France, and, by the treaty of Paris, 1763,
the proud possessor of all of the eastern half of this continent,
of India, mistress of the seas, conscious also of the
great advantages that the invention of the steam engine,
the power loom and other machinery gave her, she dispatched
explorers to scan the different quarters of the
globe for new possessions. Captain Cook outlined the
shores of Australia and of many other lands of the south
seas, and in 1778 was off the Oregon coast. At the same
time enterprising Britons were pressing westward along
the Great Lakes and overland toward this still available
portion of the continent. Thus, the progressive nations
of the world were closing in on this last choice imperial
domain of the temperate zone awaiting a pre-emptor&mdash;the
possessor of which would be the natural master of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
the Pacific. At this critical juncture the then young
American nation was fortunate in the spirit of maritime
enterprise among the merchants of Boston. Seeking the
profits of trade in furs which the voyage of Cook had
revealed, they sent Captains Gray and Kendrick to the
North Pacific coast, and in 1792 Gray, in the ship Columbia,
performed the feat that secured to this country priority
of right to the basin of the Columbia. Still more
fortunate was this country at this time in having the
prescient mind of Thomas Jefferson devoted to its interests.
While Gray's vessel was lying in the Columbia he
was getting up a subscription for sending explorers overland
to the Pacific. Even ten years before this he had
proposed an expedition to the Pacific under the leadership
of George Rogers Clark. He then had it in mind
to head off an English enterprise of which he had heard;
but it was not until 1803, twenty years after his first
effort in this direction, that Jefferson succeeded in getting
the means for the first and by far the most important of
our national exploring expeditions&mdash;the Lewis and Clark.</p>

<p>But this was not simply an exploring expedition. It
represents better than any other one event the expansion
of this nation from the Mississippi to the Pacific. The
expedition was great not merely even in what it symbolizes.
It was grandly great in itself, in its inception, and
in execution. It was the herald of the American democracy
making its way across the continent to the Pacific,
but it was more. There was the highest nobility of purpose
in its inception, and matchless skill and fortitude in
its execution. Not only in the train of its consequences,
but in every aspect was it glorious and worthy of a national
celebration. The burden of the special message of
January 18, 1803, through which President Jefferson
secured an appropriation for it, was the maintenance of
the factory system, or the trading posts, among the Indian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
tribes of the west. Jefferson took keenest delight in a
project to extend the bounds of knowledge and which he
hoped would open a water route of commerce across the
continent with Asia. Yet on the face of it the Lewis and
Clark expedition had primarily its inception as a means
for promoting the success of these government trading
posts among the Indians. This governmental policy,
connected with the administration of the factory system,
was the one comprehensive, wise, and humane national
effort to raise a lower race to the plane of civilization.
The idea was to supply the Indian at cost, in exchange
for his furs and other products, the implements of husbandry
and the comforts of civilized life, at the same
time to protect him from the demoralizing influences of
the vicious among the white men. The Lewis and Clark
expedition was thus in its origin associated with a work
of the largest philanthropy, "a system," says Captain
Chittenden, author of "The American Fur Trade in the
Far West," "which, if followed out as it should have
been, would have led the Indian to his new destiny by
easy stages, and would have averted the long and bloody
wars, corruption, and bad faith, which have gained for
a hundred years of our dealings with the Indians the
unenviable distinction of a 'Century of Dishonor.'"</p>

<p>In his instructions to the leaders of the expedition Jefferson
showed the tenderest solicitude for the welfare of
the red man. The expedition could not have been in
better hands. Captain Chittenden says of it: "This
celebrated performance stands as incomparably the most
perfect achievement of its kind in the history of the
world." Dr. Elliott Coues has this about it: "The story
of this adventure stands easily first and alone. This is
our national epic of exploration." To appreciate the
unique skill of leadership in this expedition we need but
compare its success with the wretched failure of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
"Yellowstone Expedition" of 1820, which was to have
gone over but a part of the route of Lewis and Clark.
This had an outfit many times more expensive than that
of Lewis and Clark and ten times as many men; but it
went to pieces before it got beyond what is now Omaha.</p>

<p>Unique as the Lewis and Clark expedition was in its
original purposes and in its execution, the Oregon people
are sponsors for the celebration of its coming centennial
anniversary mainly because of the consequences with
which it was fraught. Theodore Roosevelt, in his "Winning
of the West," speaks of it as opening "the door into
the heart of the West." His book has the date mark
"1896." It was written before the battle of Manila, and
the treaty closing the Spanish-American war which placed
the Philippines permanently under our care, before America's
determining part in preserving the integrity of China
after the quelling of the Boxer insurrection. It was
written before President Roosevelt had set his eyes upon
the Pacific Northwest. If, after the latter days of this
month (May), he ever again has occasion to characterize
the import of the Lewis and Clark expedition, his dictum
will be more like this: "It led to the acquisition of the
whole Pacific Coast, containing the fairest and richest
regions under the American flag, and made inevitable
the American mastery of the Pacific and American supremacy
among the nations of the world." It is, surely,
not preposterous to expect a revision of the verdict of
history on the significance of the Lewis and Clark expedition.
Henry Adams, than whom no scholar has done
better work on the history of the United States, in volume
IV of his history, with date mark, 1890, speaks of
the Lewis and Clark expedition in this wise: "The
crossing of the continent was a great feat, but it was
nothing more. * * Great gains to civilization could be
made only on the Atlantic coast under the protection of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
civilized life." Mr. Adams in this estimate seems wholly
blind to the fact that nations like individuals have opportunities
presented to them which seized may not give
immediate results but which have an ever increasing
influence upon their destiny. In the Lewis and Clark
expedition this nation took the flood tide to world supremacy.
Three years ago, when American arms and
diplomacy were exercising such a determining influence
on the problem of mankind in China, I heard Prof.
F. J. Turner of the University of Wisconsin, the highest
authority on western history, who writes so forcibly on
the Louisiana Purchase in the current number of the
<i>Review of Reviews</i>, say, that "the occupation of the Pacific
Coast by the American people was not only the
greatest event in American history, but a great event in
all history."</p>

<p>That the American movement Oregonward and Pacificward
followed strictly in the wake of the Lewis and Clark
expedition has many proofs. Even before Lewis and
Clark reached Saint Louis on their homeward journey they
met parties of traders and trappers bound for the heart
of the wilderness from which they were returning. These
were acting on the information Lewis and Clark had sent
back from their Mandan winter quarters.
A few months after they reached Saint Louis the Missouri
Fur Company was organized to conduct operations on
the Upper Missouri, that is, on the trail of Lewis and
Clark. Four years later John Jacob Astor organized the
Pacific Fur Company, and devised plans including
a great emporium at the mouth of the Columbia, trade
with China on the west, with the Russian settlements on
the north, and a line of trading posts overland on the
Lewis and Clark route. Astor's scheme was a feasible
one, but the war of 1812 came on and England dispatched
a vessel to capture the American post on the Columbia.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Before this reached Astoria the British sympathizers
among Astor's partners sold him out. Astor was probably
the first to have a vision not only of what the nation
was to gain on this coast, but also of what more might
have been gained had President Madison been as bold in
regard to his enterprise as was Jefferson in the Louisiana
purchase. Had this been so Captain Chittenden thinks
"the political map of North America would not be what
it is to-day," implying that there would have been an
uninterrupted American Pacific coast line from the extreme
north to the Mexican boundary.</p>

<p>So far our rights to the region were based on priority
in discovery, in exploration, and in occupation; but now
for a period of thirty years the British Hudson Bay Company
was to have almost undisputed possession. However,
the rights established by Gray, Lewis and Clark,
and Astor did not lapse and could not be set aside through
occupation by a mere trading company. During nearly
all of this thirty-year period the Boston schoolmaster,
Hall J. Kelley, was agitating the colonization of Oregon,
and in 1832, and again in 1834, Nathaniel J. Wyeth,
with herculean effort, indomitable perseverance, and incredible
energy led expeditions to the Columbia only to
meet with disaster when with his slender means he was
pitted against the mighty corporation in possession here.
With Wyeth came the first party of missionaries. The
"Mountain Men"&mdash;retired trappers&mdash;soon followed, seeking
homes here; and, beginning with 1842, annual migrations
of thousands of Oregon pioneers were on the
way. The Lewis and Clark exploration had thus led to a
national movement&mdash;"the migration of a people," says
Captain Chittenden, "seeking to avail itself of opportunities
which have come but rarely in the history of the
world, and which will never come again." The route
traced by these Oregon pioneers will some day be restored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
as a national memorial highway, and will be celebrated
in song and story, every mile of which has the tenderest
associations of hardship and suffering, but also of high
purpose and stern determination; and yet the Oregon
trail was in the strictest sense a derivative of the Lewis
and Clark trail. For nearly twenty years the Lewis and
Clark route up the Missouri River had been the only one
used to reach the Rocky-mountain wilderness, but in the
fall of 1823 a party of trappers, pushing westward from
the Yellowstone and desirous of avoiding the implacable
Blackfeet on the Upper Missouri, turned to the south and
discovered in South Pass, an easy crossing of the Rocky
Mountains. The region beyond on the headwaters of the
Green and Snake rivers, and in the basin of the Great
Salt Lake, was found to be rich in furs. Henceforth to
some point in this region the annual cavalcades of the
fur companies would come and there meet their own
trappers, the free trappers, and the Indians of all the interior
country. This was the annual rendezvous for trading,
for the delivery of the season's catch of furs, and for
equipment for the next year's activity. In making this
annual round trip from Saint Louis the original route
into this transmontane country, the half-circle route along
the Missouri, was naturally abandoned for a great cut-off
from the western borders of Missouri to the South Pass.
A direct route northwestward across the plains of present
Kansas and Nebraska to the Platte, up the Platte and
the North Fork and its tributary, the Sweetwater, was
found to be the finest natural highway in the world. To
reach Oregon the pioneers took this great cut off of the
Lewis and Clark trail, and from its western terminus on
the upper waters of the Snake they had but to follow the
route of Hunt's Astor party until the original Lewis and
Clark trail was struck again on the Columbia. The Lewis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
and Clark trail was thus the basis from which was developed
the Oregon trail.</p>

<p>During the forties, when the national movement was
setting strongly towards the Pacific, Oregon was an uppermost
subject in the thought, and frequently in the
plans, of a large portion of the people of this country.
Oregon pioneers were clinching our hold upon the Pacific
coast. The party slogan of "fifty-four forty or fight" in
1844 had response deep in the hearts of a great majority
of the people of the northern part of the Mississippi Valley,
and stirred the whole nation. American influences
and activities in California from 1846 on radiated mainly
from Oregon. Captain Fremont was sent out originally
to explore the best route to Oregon, and went to California
from Oregon. William Marshall, the discoverer of
gold in California in 1848 was an Oregon pioneer of 1844.
Peter H. Burnett, the first governor of California, was
an Oregon pioneer of 1843. The exclusion of slave labor
from the mines of California was largely due to the "Columbia-river
men." But now at the close of the forties
came the diversion of the national interest from Oregon
amounting almost to an eclipse of Oregon for some fifty
years. The annexation of Texas, the war with Mexico, the
gold discovery in California, the opening of the Kansas
and Nebraska lands, the civil war, the development of the
manufacturing industries, the occupation of the Dakotas,
absorbed in turn the main attention and energies of the
nation, leaving outlying Oregon in comparative obscurity,
with resources developing but slowly.</p>

<p>Oregon's day, however, is dawning again. America's
surplus energy is no longer absorbed in gold mining in
California, in occupying the plains of Kansas, Nebraska,
or the Dakotas. The overloaded passenger trains to the
Pacific Northwest tell unmistakably the nation's need of
this region. It needs our farm lands. It will more and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
more urgently need our lumber and our water power and
our outlook upon the Pacific; and to whom do the American
people owe the possession of these incomparable and
growing boons but to Lewis and Clark and to the pioneers
to whom Lewis and Clark pointed the way. Governor
Chamberlain was right the other night when at Boise he
spoke of the Lewis and Clark expedition as Jefferson's
greatest act. Alongside the two inscriptions on Jefferson's
monument selected by him, namely, that he was the
author of the Declaration of Independence and that he
was the founder of the University of Virginia, posterity
will fain inscribe the fact that he was the promoter and
organizer of the Lewis and Clark expedition.</p>

<p>The observance of the Lewis and Clark Centennial,
therefore, is an occasion in which the American people
as a whole and through their government have the largest
reasons for generous participation. For great was the
Oregon opportunity to the nation and the Lewis and Clark
expedition was the key that opened it. All honor from
the nation at large is due to those who made this national
opportunity and seized it. The possession of the Pacific
coast was the corollary and sequel to the Oregon movement;
but the Oregon movement itself was corollary to
nothing less than the spirit and vigor of the American
people and their foothold upon this continent.</p>

<p>We have, then, a national occasion second only to that
of Philadelphia in 1876; and the first great mission of
the centennial will be realized when its occasion has
been so interpreted and enforced that a hearty and liberal
participation in the celebration on the part of the nation
has been secured so that our American national consciousness
may fully realize what has been "the course of empire"
with us as a nation and what it is almost certain to
be in the future.</p>

<p>The accomplishment of the other mission of the exposition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
requires a true interpretation of the problem of
largest progress for the Pacific Northwest. Expositions
worthy of the name can not be "hit or miss" affairs. They
are not mere congeries of remarkable products. An exposition
should have an organic unity and a distinct aim.
Its aim must bear directly on the highest interests of the
supporting community. There are peculiar reasons for
the exercise of the highest degree of care and insight in
the organization of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition.
No people ever before invested so heavily in
proportion to their means as Portland and Oregon propose
to invest in the Lewis and Clark Centennial. No
exposition was ever held in a community so plastic, so
completely in the making as are Portland and Oregon.
The current of common thought and effort is so strongly
set toward the Lewis and Clark Centennial that the very
cast of Oregon's civilization in the future will surely come
from what is realized in that event. The exposition will
leave an inspired, unified, and enlightened people, with
ideals newly defined and elevated; or it will be followed
by more or less of humiliation, factional strife, disgrace,
blighting discouragement, with sordid ideals and disordered
social relations.</p>

<p>Most auspicious was Oregon's response to the idea of
a celebration. Stronger faith in the good that may come
from unity in action toward higher things no other people
has ever shown; and why should not Oregon have
faith in greater things for herself and the Pacific Northwest?
The Pacific Northwest bears almost exactly the
same relation to the rest of the nation east of us geographically,
historically, and economically that Greece
bore to the Orient, and that England bore to the continental
nations of Europe.</p>

<p>I take it, then, that the normal attitude towards the
exposition project is one that regards it as a serious undertaking,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
having tremendous possibilities for making or
marring much in the future of Oregon. The exposition
comes when Oregon is just at the flood tide of new opportunities&mdash;opportunities
that require twentieth century
enlightenment on the part of the masses if these
opportunities are to yield anything like unmixed good.
Just as the Lewis and Clark expedition was the key that
opened the Oregon opportunity to the nation so is the
Lewis and Clark Centennial admirably adapted to become
the key to open the way to the highest development of
industrial democracy in the Pacific Northwest and to
realize its leadership in social progress on this continent.
We have, I think, a fine example given us by the authorities
of Louisiana Purchase Exposition of how to plan
definitely an exposition to accomplish a great purpose.
The main idea with them is to make a world's fair for
the first time represent the world in epitome as a "going
concern." They thus express their main purpose: "As
to the lesson for the world, the Directorate desire to make
a leading point. It is to show life and movement. * *
An attempt will be made to put the world before the eye
of the visitor, each exhibit being so displayed as to make
plain its story, its purpose, and its aim." And again:
"The Department of Education is made the first department
of the classification in accordance with the theory
upon which the entire exposition is founded. * * *
Through education man comes to a knowledge of his
powers, and of the possibilities of life, and upon it are
dependent the processes which extend throughout all the
fields of industry. This correlation of the powers of the
brain and of the hand of man, extending throughout the
entire exhibit scheme of the exposition, will, for the first
time in the history of expositions, afford a strictly scientific
basis for the collection and classification of objects."
And finally: "At Saint Louis, the prevailing characteristic,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
it is intended, shall be life and motion, and the installation
of products and processes in juxtaposition.
The classification is based upon this plan, and its effects
upon the proportions of the buildings is noticeable in
that Machinery Hall is relatively so small in area. The
machines through whose operation raw material is converted
into use and the processes employed in utilizing
natural products will be exhibited, so that not only will
the fund of human information be greatly increased, but
suggestion will be made to students, scientists, and inventors
that will give still greater development to genius
in the following than in the preceding decade."</p>

<p>The World's Fair, in this carefully planned purpose,
affords a fine model for the Lewis and Clark Exposition.
But Portland is not simply to do for the Pacific Northwest
and the other peoples in close economic and commercial
relations with it what Saint Louis aspires to do
for the world. Saint Louis undertakes what was distinctively
the nineteenth century problem&mdash;that of mastery
by man of the physical forces of the world and of
more nearly perfect adjustment to his natural environment.
The Louisiana Purchase Exposition, with its
World Congress of the Arts and Sciences, and all of its
exhibits arranged to promote the development of invention
and the application of scientific methods to industry,
has a great mission; and yet the peculiar field which
belongs to the Lewis and Clark Exposition gives it, if not
a greater mission, at least one more advanced&mdash;if you
please a twentieth century mission. Man in the Pacific
Northwest has a peculiar problem. All the science and
art of the past are his legacy. They fairly press in upon
him in their appeal to him for utilization here. Man
here has a physical environment so rich and so diversified
as not only to invite the largest application of science
and art, but also one that demands the highest organization
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
of associated effort. In other words, the Pacific
Northwest places man in such relation to history, to
nature, and to his fellow-man, as to promise him here,
if his inheritance is not sold for a mess of pottage, man's
highest development. It rests with the Lewis and Clark
Exposition to rise to the occasion. For it represents a
first possible step in a grand cooperative effort to develop
a social environment here commensurate with what nature
has done for us. If for a ruthless, wasteful course
of social evolution that would never reach any desirable
goal we would realize one of steady, frictionless progress,
with opportunities of fullest life open to all, we must
make the Lewis and Clark Centennial fulfill its high
mission. If the people of Oregon and the Pacific Northwest
do not persist in their determination to make this
concerted effort toward the inauguration of the highest
policies of social progress here it is hard to see what occasion
can bring them so near this mood again. It is
the spell that the commemoration of a great event and
a great movement casts over them that will hardly be
repeated. The Lewis and Clark Centennial then is the
flood tide of opportunity. If it is not seized and we lapse
again into mere individualistic policies "all the voyage"
of life in the future of the Pacific Northwest will be
bound in comparative "shallows and in miseries."</p>

<p>An exposition planned to meet the twentieth century
needs becomes the herald of an industrial democracy in
which there is a completely harmonious cooperation for
the realization of the highest social ideals. It is dawning
upon us that publicity is the first condition of relief
from the trust evil. We need yet, however, to realize
that essential publicity or light is the talisman for developing
a true democratic spirit to which are disclosed
ever expanding vistas of possibilities. The first great duty
of the exposition authorities is to bring to the people of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the Pacific Northwest the largest enlightenment on the
natural resources of this region. Taking our timber resources
as an illustration, we are painfully aware that the
timber holdings are not as widely and equably distributed
among the masses as one could wish; but we have many
rich natural monopolies which the whole people should
share. They have common and incalculable permanent
interests in the forests of Oregon, in the water power of
our streams, in our facilities for irrigation, in the mines,
and in the ensemble of natural beauty here. Shall the
great natural forest areas in Oregon which may become
the source of an ever increasing flow of wealth for all
time for the whole people be allowed, without state forestry
activity, to become mere waste places for weed
trees? We are told by Mr. Elwood Mead, Chief of the
Division of Irrigation, that he believes Oregon "has the
largest area of unimproved land whereon irrigation is
possible of any State in the Union." Here is a great
interest in which most fortunately a policy of coöperation
between the state and the nation has been instituted.
What could be more propitious for the good fortune of
the people than an active coöperation between the authorities
of the exposition and the United States bureaus of
forestry, irrigation, and the United States geological survey
in preparing an exhibit of the data on the interests
of the people of the State in these natural resources?
With such definite, earnest, and laudable purposes in
view, Congress and the Administration would respond to
the claims of the Lewis and Clark Exposition in a very
different spirit from that with which they have met
recent expositions.</p>

<p>By means of models, relief maps, photographs, drawings,
charts, and graphic representations generally, along
with congresses and the discussions by the press, the people,
and their legislators, would come to take an intelligent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
and far-sighted view of these great inheritances of
theirs. A whole summer given to the exposition of the
people's interests in their common heritage, with the use
of the best art of illustration, representation, and elucidation,
would awaken a living interest so that they would
make sure of their rights, conserve an equality of opportunities
and make our natural resources yield their highest
social utility. Our experience with our state school
lands shows that such a fortunate condition is absolutely
impossible without the influence an exposition could exert
toward an enlightenment on our public inheritances.</p>

<p>The Municipal Exposition at Dresden, Germany, during
this summer, gives a suggestion for a municipal department
for our exposition that would work a transformation
in our civic spirit and enlightenment. How
glorious it would be for Oregon if the Lewis and Clark
Fair Clubs would in dead earnest determine to possess
themselves of the philosophy of city making, and to do
their best to control municipal activity in Oregon so as to
make it conserve highest economic and æsthetic ends and
bring about rational unity in all municipal development
and foster an architectural spirit. Why not commission
a delegate to Dresden? Why not begin to make wholesome,
beautiful, and edifying the Oregon village and city,
so that, as a whole, each may be a positive joy forever?
The same strenuous idealism would find a rich field in
the affairs of our counties and of our school districts.
The Oregon farm must come in for as many meliorating
influences as the Oregon town. All that good roads,
graded schools, traveling libraries, neighborhood telephones,
and model farm establishments can do to elevate
the social conditions of farm life will be greatly furthered
by the exposition; but the problem that is fundamental
with the people, both of the town and of the country, pertains
not merely to sharing the unearned increment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
the natural and artificial monopolies, but also to participation
in the gains of all capitalized industry. It is the
problem of "peopleizing" the industries. Corporate organization
and management should be a department of
the exposition. By the elimination of all the unnecessary
risk in investments in corporation securities through
effective governmental regulation and supervision the
people may gain control and reap the large profits of capitalized
industry. The exposition will have its highest
mission in securing to the people an interest in the gains
and a share in the control of our industrial organizations.</p>

<p>The next generation of Oregonians will not be found
wanting in their ardor for the welfare of the state as a
whole, in patriotic zeal for the betterment of all the conditions
of life here and in aspiration to give the Pacific
Northwest leadership in social progress if the schools are
furnished the story of the Oregon opportunity as it was
made and realized. This, as told by the actors themselves,
should be compiled and distributed to the districts.
The highest pitch of emulation to the mastery of this
story and interest in the aims of the exposition may advisedly
be secured by a system of prize essays on important
topics pertaining to Oregon's development.</p>

<p>This outline of the features that the exposition might
include does not debar from it popular and recreative
attractions. It does not slur the exhibition of the remarkable
products of the farm, the orchard, the mine,
the river, the forests, and the factory. The ideas emphasized
will only give these products multiplied significance,
bringing them into vital relations with life that is more
than meat, drink, and wear. An exposition thus rationally
planned will be the poor man's greatest hope. If
he loses the aid it would give him toward the right solution
of the social problem the odds are terribly against
him in the race for an equitable distribution. Such an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
exposition would go far toward securing an open door to
an equality of opportunity for all in Oregon. To block
the organization of such an exposition would not be far
from social suicide for the masses.</p>

<p>The dominance of economic forces in progress is becoming
more and more exclusive. It devolves upon the
people to comprehend fully the living forces, and, by
comprehending them, put themselves in position to control
them and mold them to the higher uses of conserving
an equality of opportunity for all. The Lewis and Clark
Exposition lends itself wholly to this great mission. It
is hard to see how a means quite so propitious will be
available again.</p>

<h3>THE EDUCATIONAL HISTORY OF
ASTORIA, OREGON.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>The study of the school history of Astoria is of interest
to the student of education in that it reveals a condition
different from that of some of the other cities of
Oregon, particularly those of the Willamette Valley. In
the latter, private and public schools struggled for the
mastery, with the private school far in the lead for many
years.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In Astoria, on the contrary, the public school
idea had a firm hold from the beginning and asserted itself
as soon as the establishment of a public school was possible.
The history of Astoria's educational progress,
covering a period of fifty-two years, is chiefly the story
of the beginning and gradual development of a system
of public schools. There is traceable, however, something
of the conflict, so prominent elsewhere, between
the public and the private school idea.</p>

<h4>PRIVATE SCHOOLS.</h4>

<p>Astoria's first school, started in 1851, was of necessity
private, owing to the fact that the school law, passed in
1849, was practically inoperative, and, in consequence,
no public money was available. In the summer of 1851
the Rev. C. O. Hosford, a Methodist minister, at the
earnest solicitation of some dozen parents, opened a
school near the corner of Eighth and Bond streets, in a
small two-room building, erected for use as dwelling
house for the teacher, and schoolhouse.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This little pioneer
school had an enrollment of ten pupils, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
supported by private subscription. Public sentiment favored
a public school, and its modifying influence is seen
at this time. No tuition was charged the individual
pupil, but the parents contributed toward the support of
the school each according to his means rather than in
proportion to the number of children he sent to the
school. Mr. V. Boelling, in addition to furnishing the
schoolhouse and residence for the teacher free of charge,
contributed twenty of the forty dollars paid monthly to
the teacher.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The school was in session during the
months of June, July, August, and September.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It is probable that between the closing of this school
and the starting of the public school proper there were
other semi-public schools.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Private schools were a necessity
in Upper Astoria, owing to the small number
of families there and the lack of means of communication
between the two parts of the town. There were at
least two private schools here prior to 1859, and they
were patronized by the children of three families.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> That
this was done in at least one case from necessity, rather
than choice, is shown by the fact that one of the patrons
of these schools, T. P. Powers, a few years later, was the
prime mover in the establishment of the Upper Astoria
public school.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Miss Pope and Mrs. H. B. Morse were
two of the teachers employed in these schools.</p>

<p>In 1864 the first school that was in any sense a rival
of the public school was started. The Grace Church Parish
School became the rallying point for the first opposition
to public education. This support alone would
perhaps not have been sufficient to maintain it; but it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
also filled a place in the educational field which the public
school seemed unable to occupy. That there was a real
need for the school is apparent from the class of pupils
that attended it. Large pupils who, owing to lack of
early advantages, were far behind in their classes and
who would have preferred to remain away rather than be
classed with children much younger than themselves, and
pupils advanced beyond the studies offered at the time by
the district school, made up a large part of the number
in attendance.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Latin, algebra, natural philosophy, and
other advanced subjects were taught, and pupils for these
studies came from the public school which had just previous
to this time decided to exclude all branches beyond
those usually taught in a district school.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>This school was opened in the old "Methodist Church"
situated on the corner of Fifteenth Street and Franklin
Avenue, and was in charge of the rector of the Episcopal
Church, Rev. T. H. Hyland. Mrs. Hyland, who had
been a teacher in the East, taught most of the classes.<a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The school was supported entirely by tuition fees which
were $7 per quarter of thirteen weeks. Three quarters
were taught each year, and the attendance ranged between
twenty and thirty pupils.<a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Rev. Mr. Hyland was appointed to the Astoria parish
while it was a missionary station and so received no
salary from the home congregation. The parish school
was started chiefly as a means of revenue to help pay for
the maintenance of the church.<a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Former pupils testify
to the excellence of the school and to the popularity of its
founders and teachers.</p>

<p>In 1866 the school moved to the rear of the church on
Commercial Street, between Eighth and Ninth, and continued
regularly until the departure of Rev. Mr. Hyland
and wife in 1878.<a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>During the fall and winter of 1876-77 a night school,
at which bookkeeping, writing, and arithmetic were
taught, was taught by Mr. Kincaid in the Gray building.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>In 1878 there were at least four private schools in Astoria.
Mrs. Maxwell Young taught a school of twenty-five
pupils in a building where St. Mary's Hospital
stands.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Miss Cora VanDusen taught a summer session
in the building near the southeast corner of Tenth and
Duane streets, which was rented by the school board and
furnished to Miss VanDusen free of charge during the
vacation of the public school.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> When the public school
opened in the fall this school was moved to the room formerly
occupied by the parish school. Professor Worthington,
principal of the public school, taught a private
school of six pupils. The fourth private school was
taught by Miss Johnson.</p>

<p>The increase in the number of private schools was due
to two causes: dissatisfaction in some quarters with some
action of the principal of the "lower town school,"<a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and
the great increase in the school population. The latter
cause was no doubt the more potent. At this time there
were over five hundred children of school age in Astoria.</p>

<p>In 1881-82 Miss Hewett conducted a private school at
Grace Church, with an average attendance of twenty-six
pupils and an enrollment of forty-six.</p>

<p>From 1886 to 1895 Miss Emma C. Warren conducted
a private school on Exchange Street, between Eleventh
and Twelfth. This was by far the largest and most pretentious
private school ever opened in Astoria, and yet
represented only to a very small degree the idea antagonistic
to the public school. All the grammar grades were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
taught, and also classes in advanced subjects, including
Latin and German.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> This school occupied to a great
extent the place that should have been filled by a public
high school. With the establishment of the high school
in 1890-91 its field of usefulness was greatly limited, and
in 1895 it was merged into the high school by the employment
of the principal, Miss Warren, as the head of
the department of English and English Literature, and the
entrance of most of the pupils of Miss Warren's school
into the high school.<a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<h4>THE PUBLIC SCHOOL.</h4>

<p>The earliest schools of Astoria were supported by private
funds, yet the payment of any fixed sum was not
made a condition for entrance. They were supported by
private subscription for the benefit of all the children of
the town.</p>

<p>In 1854 District No. 1 was established, and included a
large tract of land bounded by Young's River, from the
falls to its juncture with Columbia, the Columbia River
and a zigzag line starting near Thirty-eighth Street, and
connecting the Columbia River with the Young's River
Falls.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> To this district, in October of the same year, was
paid the sum of $20, all the school money then available.<a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
The next year, under the revised law of 1853-54,
the county fund yielded more, and District No. 1 received
$104.77. A part of this amount was from tax, and the
rest from fines.<a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The first school taught after the district was organized,
as near as can be ascertained (there are no records in existence),
was taught in what was known as the "Old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Methodist Church,"<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> a building erected in 1853-54,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> on
a piece of land donated for church and school purposes,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
by James Welch, to the trustees of the Methodist Church.
J. W. Wayne was probably the first teacher in the district.
Nothing is known of the condition of the school,
except that there were very few in attendance, and the
school was in session only a very few months. Miss Liza
Lincoln, Mrs. Hill, an English lady, and Mr. Moore, are
names associated with the early schools, but the exact
time of their service is not known, but all taught school
some time before 1856.</p>

<p>In that year Judge A. A. Skinner took charge of the
public school in a building near Bain's Mill, known as
the "Holman House."<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> He was assisted by Mrs. Skinner,
<i>nee</i> Miss Lincoln. The next year the public school
was taught by Mr. Brown in the "old hospital" building,
situated between Ninth and Tenth streets, on Duane.
Mr. Brown is remembered for his skill in handling the
large boys.<a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> He was succeeded by Mr. Maxwell.</p>

<p>Up to this time the district had been without a schoolhouse,
but in 1859 a building was erected on the corner
of Ninth and Exchange streets. J. T. Maulsby taught
the first term of school in it in 1860. The school was
now too large for one teacher and the following year the
board engaged the services of J. D. Deardorff and wife.
He was a man of ability in his line of work and was well
liked by both parents and pupils.<a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> During the next term
he was assisted by Mrs. Dr. Owens-Adair,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and the year
following by Mr. Williamson,<a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> a college bred man, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
assisted much in building up the reputation of the school.
Under Mr. Deardorff's management a nine or ten months'
term was taught each year, and there were between ninety
and one hundred pupils in attendance.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Astoria was
maintaining an expensive school, and the money for its
support was raised almost entirely by tax and private
subscription,<a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> as the money from the county school fund
was inconsiderable at this time. This fund yielded to
the district $132.50 in 1861, $149.80 in 1862, and $92.85
in 1863.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> There is no record of tuition ever having been
charged the pupils of the district. While Mr. Deardorff
taught advanced classes were formed and pupils who had
finished the ordinary grades of the school were enabled
to continue their education.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Later opposition to these
classes arose and finally the school board decided that
only studies of the grammar grade should be taught.
When this order was carried into effect, during Mr. R. K.
Warren's term as teacher, a vigorous protest was made
against it, and its enforcement caused much dissatisfaction.<a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The Grace Church Parish School had just been organized,
and, no doubt, profited by the dissension in the
ranks of the friends of the public school. The increasing
burden of maintaining the school and the presence of
the parish school ready to receive the advanced pupils,
gave strength to the position of those who were opposed
to teaching branches above the grade of the ordinary
district school.</p>

<p>In 1865 there was an average attendance of one hundred
and ten pupils and a nine months' term.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This year
the four districts of the county received $460.72 from the
county fund and raised $2,308.49 by district tax.[##23]</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>In 1868-69 the average attendance in the public schools
had dropped to eighty-four,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> caused, in all probability,
by the exclusion of the advanced classes and their transfer
to the Grace Church Parish School.</p>

<p>Mr. Finlayson and wife and Professor Robb were the
teachers between 1865 and 1869. From 1869 to 1873 very
little change in the condition of the school is noted, except
that there was a slight increase in attendance due to the
return to the policy of providing instruction for all who
had finished the grammar grades. In 1872 the state
school fund became available and District No. 1 received
$110.80 in coin and $111.95 in currency.<a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>In 1873 Prof. W. L. Worthington, a very able instructor,
was elected principal, and remained several
years. More than one hundred children were in attendance
in 1873,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and the citizens of Astoria were justly
proud of their school. The <i>Astorian</i> in its initial number<a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
says: "We notice that the school is well supplied
with maps, charts, dictionaries, gazetteers, atlases, etc.
We doubt that any common school in Oregon is better
supplied with such articles. * * The public school affords
every opportunity for getting a good English education."
The teachers were Professor Worthington,
principal; Miss Watt and Miss Lawrence, assistants.<a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The history from 1873 is concerned chiefly with the
rapid increase in the school population, the division of
the district into six separate districts, the subsequent
consolidation of all these districts, the final readjustment
of the boundaries, so as to include only the schools within
the corporate limits of Astoria, and the establishment of
the high school, as the completion of the city's educational
system.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>District No. 9, the "Upper Astoria" district, was established
in 1868, but no school was taught here until 1874.
Mrs. W. W. Parker, who taught the first term of school
in the district, had a school of fifteen pupils, and received
as compensation $75 per month and board.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> T. P. Powers
organized the district, and when over seventy years of
age taught a term of three months in this district in order
that the right to draw school money should not be forfeited.</p>

<p>The population of Astoria in the two years between
1874-76 nearly doubled, owing to the rapid growth of the
fishing industry, and the schools were not able to keep
pace with this growth.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In 1878 there were over two
hundred pupils in actual attendance at the "lower schoolhouse."
Professor Worthington, the principal, was assisted
by Miss Brown, Miss McGregor, Miss Neale, and
Miss Hewett.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> In the first, or highest grade, algebra,
physiology, and natural philosophy were taught.<a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The
<i>Astorian</i> says of the school: "The public school of Astoria
is divided into three grades, with three classes in each
grade. There has been a written examination in three
of the grades [probably classes]. In this examination
great care has been taken to make it impossible for the
pupils to derive any assistance from text-books or from
friends."<a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>This crowded condition lasted until 1880 when a temporary
relief was afforded by the establishment of District
No. 9 and the building of two of the six rooms of the
Shirely school. A ten-mill tax was levied for this purpose.</p>

<p>The sudden increase in the school population brought
with it such a large proportion of the county and state
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
school fund that the money from this source, amounting
to $1,953.67,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> paid the entire cost of the school during
the year 1876, the six-mill tax not having been used.
"The district is now out of debt, and has $250 cash on
hand."<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The erection of a new school building was the main
question before the taxpayers at the school meeting of
1882. That it was a necessity was admitted by all. The
<i>Astorian</i> said editorially: "There are three things Astoria
needs&mdash;and we place them in their relative importance&mdash;a
new schoolhouse, a flouring mill, and a new theater."<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>At the meeting held April 24, 1882, four mills for current
expenses and five mills for building purposes were
levied and a new schoolhouse ordered built.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The present
McClure is the result of that meeting.</p>

<p>District No. 26, known locally as Alderbrook, was established
in 1890.</p>

<p>By a legislative act of 1892 the four districts, now included
in the city schools, together with the schools at
John Days and Walluski, were consolidated into one district
of the first class. This arrangement proved unsatisfactory,
and in 1899 the boundaries were again changed
so as to exclude the two districts lying outside the corporate
limits of the city.</p>

<p>During the fifty years that the public school system
has been in existence the school population has increased
an hundredfold. The distance between "upper" and
"lower" Astoria, the rapid growth of the town during
the seventies, made the division of the district almost a
necessity. The gradual growing together of the two parts
of the town making the interchange of classes possible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
and the consequent improvement of the schools with a
lessening of the expense of maintaining them led to the
consolidation in 1893 and the readjustment of the boundaries
in 1899.</p>

<h4>THE HIGH SCHOOL.</h4>

<p>The high school is the result of a slow growth and its
continued existence is due perhaps as much to indifference
as to any very active sentiment in its favor. It
started as an advanced grade of the public school when
for financial reasons it was desired to keep as many
pupils as possible in attendance. The presence of the
large pupils and the quality of the work done gave the
school a standing in outside districts and created a feeling
of pride in the citizens of the town. The higher
classes were disbanded in 1863 or 1864. The <i>Marine Gazette</i>
thus comments: "During the past week we have
noticed considerable discussion in doors and out about
the village district school. * * It was generally admitted
that the school of eighteen months ago, I think it was&mdash;at
any rate the one that contained all the larger boys and
girls of the village with several others from Clatsop
Plains, Oysterville, etc.,&mdash;was the best school we had
had for three years or even a longer period. * * About
the time named the teacher was restricted as to the
amount or kind of instruction to be given in the school
to the so-called advanced pupils. This restriction caused
the disbanding or dismissal of several classes of the
largest and oldest pupils. They quit the school, dispersed,
went home, or to other schools distant to our town."<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
Advanced studies were restored later and became a recognized
part of the course of study. The high school
sentiment, stimulated no doubt by the record of the
public for excellence in the past and to some extent by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
the desire to keep pace with the standard of scholarship
set by the private schools, increased and resulted in the
establishment of the present efficient high school in 1890
and 1891.</p>

<p>The grammar schools are loyally supported in spite of
the high rate of taxation<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> necessary to maintain them;
but there is still a well defined sentiment against the
maintenance of the high school at public expense, though
this sentiment seems to be decreasing.</p>

<h4>WHAT THE SCHOOL HISTORY OF ASTORIA REVEALS.</h4>

<p>The earliest schools were semi-public, though supported
entirely by private subscription. Public sentiment
clearly favored the public school and secured its
establishment so soon as conditions, including the necessary
school laws, made it possible. The reason for the
predominance of this sentiment in favor of the public
schools can be found in the fact that many of the leaders
in the development of the city came from the northern
and middle western states, where the idea of public education
had a firm hold. V. Boelling, S. T. McKean,
W. W. Parker, Col. James Taylor, and later Capt. George
Flavel, Mrs. H. B. Parker, John Hobson and many others
were earnest advocates and liberal supporters of public
schools.</p>

<p>The public school has had an almost uninterrupted
growth from the beginning, and to-day shows the result
of half a century of effort.</p>

<h3>AN OBJECT LESSON IN PATERNALISM</h3>

<p>Even among those who have devoted their lives to the
study of sociological problems, there is much difference
of opinion as to the quantitative and qualitative influence
of certain social conditions in producing the generally
admitted bad or adverse phases of human society.</p>

<p>At one time we read that poverty degrades men morally,
and we peruse carefully prepared and apparently veracious
tables showing that in the older countries there is
an unfailing correspondence between criminal statistics
and the price of bread; the per cent of offenses against
persons and property increasing with the cost of the necessaries
of life and diminishing with the amount of human
exertion required to obtain them. Such is the generally
received opinion of the common people, and we hear from
the political platform and see in the publications of reform
parties the assertion that it is useless to preach morals to
those whose minds are mainly occupied in devising means
to keep the wolf from the door.</p>

<p>Those of our citizens who have given special attention
to the debauching effects of the drink habit, call upon all
to come to the rescue of American homes and American
institutions, by banishing the American saloon, to which
comes the response that poverty is the principal cause of
intemperance and its incidents, and that the first duty
of patriots is to remove poverty.</p>

<p>Equally certain and circumstantial, on the other hand,
are those who affirm that there is no necessary connection
between poverty and criminality, and that, as a general
rule, debauchery and consequent decadence of moral
faculty go hand in hand with material prosperity; and
if mixed coincidence can establish casual connection, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
are not at fault, for long before Goldsmith wrote of the
time "When wealth accumulates and men decay," keen
eyed observers had connected a general laxity of morals
with the abundance and diffusion of wealth. The failure
of intertropical countries to furnish high grade men of
morals and intellect, Doctor Draper attributes, not more
to the enervating influence of heat, than to the ease with
which human beings supply themselves with the necessaries
of life. Coming down to the present period, it is
common knowledge&mdash;the expanding profligacy and criminality
of the mining camps where men could obtain extravagant
wages in gold for services which in other pursuits
would yield them a scanty living.</p>

<p>Probably from such lump comparisons and crude observations,
under complex conditions, have arisen two
schools of social economists, one whose principal and
primary aim is to abolish poverty as the chief obstacle
in the way of human progress, and the other whose purpose
is not definitely stated, but which conservatively
clings to the <i>laissez faire</i> doctrine of letting every man's
condition depend upon his individual exertion; and as
so far, in the world's history, poverty has been the condition
of the great mass of mankind, in spite of individual
exertion, the anti-poverty school of necessity, must resort
to collective or state control of the industries of men, and
thus relieve them from want and the fear of want, which
are thought to be so depressing upon their energies.</p>

<p>Just how or to what extent the state is to interfere with
the individual's management of himself, or to what extent
or in what manner he shall be relieved when he has failed
to provide for his own wants and the wants of those depending
upon him, are at present outside of any satisfactorily
practical programme, and hence collectivism
may be held to include all socialistic schemes from Bellamy
up or down.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>

<p>In fact, collectivism is entered upon the moment the
state is organized, for in the rudest criminal code there
is a manifest attempt to relieve the individual from the
otherwise caution and care necessary to defend his person
and property; and in truth, as government has advanced,
so has collectivism advanced, until now in the United
States of America the commonwealth is giving children
primary education, supporting and caring for the deaf,
blind, idiotic, insane, and criminal classes, beside stimulating
certain industries with bounties upon production
or relieving them from the disastrous effects of free competition,
by levying taxes upon competing products. It
does much more. Commerce and agriculture have been
relieved of their old time dread of the elements, for government
now keeps watch and ward over the wind and
waves, and gives timely notice of approaching disaster by
land and sea. In the endeavor to pass benefits around,
hatcheries for fish, experiment stations, laboratories, and
various commissions have been organized and conducted
at public expense; likewise the mails are carried, the
public lands distributed to actual settlers or given to railroad
companies, patents issued to inventors, bounties
paid for the destruction of wild animals, noxious weeds
exterminated, public officers appointed to examine food
products, to conduct experiments upon flocks and herds,
and to destroy those infected with contagious diseases.</p>

<p>All this and much more are the results of collectivism,
and there seems to be a constant tendency, as well as a
constant demand, for more in the same direction. Individualism
is alarmed and socialism hopeful; the former,
at the encroachments upon personal liberty and the discouragement
of personal exertion, and the latter, from
the prospect of a complete disappearance of the competitive
principle from social life.</p>

<p>Here are two violent antagonisms, while there is no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
line of demarcation between them, as well defined as the
most tortuous isothermal crossing the American continent.
There is no scientific boundary of government.
As between the two disputants it is a blind push and
pull, in which neither party is satisfied with the result.
There are gradations upon either side, and long ago Herbert
Spencer became alarmed at the coming slavery, and
that good man Gerritt Smith thought government should
have nothing to do with the education of children; that it
is altogether a private function and can not be usurped by
the state without serious injury to those most nearly interested.</p>

<p>While, however, doctrinaires have been groping for
the scientific boundary, government has gone forward
experimentally, with no chart but experience, sometimes
right and sometimes wrong, no doubt, in its endeavors
to follow the line of least resistance and do that which
seemed likely to promote the general welfare.</p>

<p>Granting the evident natural law that development is
the result of activity of faculty, and, as a consequence,
that individual improvement must come from individual
exertion, it may be safe to say that the scope of government
should be such as to give or permit the greatest
normal and harmonious activity to the units of population,
in order to bring about the greatest amount of aggregate
excellence and happiness; and still it appears to
be a matter of experience and experiment, in which science
and altruism play but a subordinate part. Nevertheless,
there should be investigation of governmental
experiments, and the great and ever recurring question
is, What do these show?</p>

<p>Has government help promoted individual competence,
and has it promoted the general welfare? In answering
this question it will not do to look at it as a whole; each
experiment must be taken by itself, and there must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
an elimination, so far as may be, of complicating and
conflicting elements. Of course there will be no attempt
in this paper to do more than report upon a single phase
of government help, and one, too, which to my knowledge
has never been utilized for throwing light upon the
great economic question. I refer to the settlement of
Oregon and Washington under government auspices. It
would seem as though there never existed more favorable
conditions for a successful experiment in planting a model
colony than were found here upon this Northwest coast.
Certainly nature was lavish and the government munificent,
and if these are chiefly instrumental in putting a
community on its feet to stay, here should be found
the living proof. Let us see; and first as to the country.</p>

<p>The Cascade range of mountains, a high ridge bearing
north and south, nearly parallel to the eastern shore of
the Pacific Ocean and about one hundred miles therefrom,
divides the states of Oregon and Washington into two
unequal parts, popularly known as Eastern and Western
Oregon and Washington. Bordering the coast of both
states is another ridge, much lower, and between these
two mountain ridges, are cross mountains connecting
them, and forming valleys with independent river systems.
These western valleys are but little above the sea
level, have moist, equable climates, abundant timber,
and rich soils; while the country east of the Cascades is
an elevated table-land, sparsely wooded, quite arid, is
subject to greater extremes of heat and cold and possessed
of a strongly alkaline soil.</p>

<p>It is to the western valleys I wish to refer in this connection,
as in these the donation land law chiefly operated
until its expiration in the year 1855. Under that
law every adult male citizen and his wife, immigrating
to this coast before the year 1851, were entitled to six
hundred and forty acres of land selected by the donees in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
such shape as they chose, and those coming after that
time, were entitled to three hundred and twenty acres
taken by legal subdivisions. Never before or since have
such magnificent inducements been offered to settlers,
and by the close of the year 1855 nearly all of the good
lands in the Willamette, Umpqua, and Rogue River valleys
were occupied by the donees who came from every
State in the Union, but chiefly from the Mississippi Valley.</p>

<p>Saying that these lands were taken by families, in section
and half-section tracts, gives but a faint idea of what
was acquired. Doctor Johnson's description of the happy
valley in Rasselas would be rather too poetical to adopt
for this country, as this is too far north for people to depend
upon the spontaneous productions of the earth, but
in many respects there is much similarity. The great
Doctor's fancy had not been expanded and enlightened
by the vast accomplishments of modern science and invention,
whereby the forces of nature have been utilized,
and, as a consequence, his happy valley was constructed
more to gratify an indolent and dreamy æstheticism than
to promote economic industry.</p>

<p>In these western valleys, however, is everything that
should stimulate men to the use of all their faculties, if
steady and sure returns for exertion are better than unearned
gratification of human wants and desires. Let
the reader picture to himself an evergreen valley one
hundred and fifty miles long and forty miles wide, a navigable
river running the whole length, through its middle,
with numerous branches on each side, the smaller rising
in the foothills, the larger emerging from the forest covered
mountains, the rich agricultural surface of the valley
interspersed with timber and prairie in profitable
proportions, and rising in gentle hills, among which are
innumerable springs of pure, soft water, or subsiding into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
lowlands, here and there dotted by buttes, and he has
the Willamette Valley, said by Saxe of Vermont to be
the best poor man's country on the globe. This picture
does not represent all its advantages by any means.</p>

<p>Probably no farming country known has water power
so abundant and diffused as here. Niagara is unrivaled
for power, but the principal question there is one of distribution.
Here the problem of distribution is reduced
to small proportions, for no village or city is far away
from water power.</p>

<p>The Cascade Mountains, through their whole extent,
are resonant with the clamorings of unused force, and
likely, in their dark fir forests will first be realized Edison's
dreams of the application of electric power,&mdash;trees
felled, cut into saw logs and conveyed to the mill, with
little of man's help except intelligent superintendence.</p>

<p>To be sure the first settlers of Oregon had no such anticipations
as these, but they were not slow to perceive
the advantages everywhere around them; sawmills were
erected in advance of the great bulk of the immigration,
so that immigrants were not required to go through the
experience of the first settlers of Ohio and Indiana,
housing one or two generations in log cabins.</p>

<p>No description of soil or surface or scenery can give an
adequate presentation of this country, as upon the climate
depends nearly everything which makes it, pre-eminently,
a never failing supplier of man's wants. In this
latitude, countries east of the Rocky Mountains have long
cold winters and short hot summers, while west of the
Cascades no such extremes are ever known.</p>

<p>The Kuro-shiwo of Japan, a broad, deep, and warm
current of ocean water flows along our western shore,
tempering the mountain air and covering the valleys
with perpetual verdure. At this writing, the twenty-fifth
of January, the fields have been once whitened with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
snow, cattle are pasturing upon unfrosted grass, and
wild daisies are in bloom. Occasionally a cold wave
from the north pushes seaward the tropical warmth,
when for a few days the inhabitants get a mitigated sample
of the arctic regions, but such incursions are few and
far between,&mdash;say once in ten years, and not to be compared
with the winter climate of Idaho, Montana, or the
Eastern States. So seldom and short are the periods,
when the ground is frozen, that agriculture is continuous
through the whole year. In every winter month plowing
is done and grain sown.</p>

<p>In what country, between the parallels forty-two and
forty-nine north latitude, would cattle live through the
winter upon grass, which was the dependence of those
who crossed the great plains to this coast in the days of
the pioneer? Arriving in these western valleys during
the months of September and October, their teams worn
and impoverished, were turned out upon the prairies and
by midwinter were fat enough for beef.</p>

<p>Such was the country and the climate of the west coast
to which the immigrants came, a land flowing with milk
(no honey), beautiful and grand beyond description, rich
beyond expectation, healthful beyond comparison; its
streams abounding with fish, and its mountains with
game; a country where there has been no failure of
crops, and where blizzards, hurricanes, and cyclones are
unknown.</p>

<p>Now a few words as to the character of the people who
settled it, and in this examination I shall try to steer
clear of the poetry and romance which are beginning to
dehumanize them. It is not necessary for the purpose
of this paper to show that the pioneers were more moral
or more intelligent than those they left in the enjoyment
of the peace and comforts of well regulated society, but
it is important to know that they were a fair average in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
all respects as human beings, and as this question can
not be determined by a personal examination, we must
resort to the environment they voluntarily chose, or, in
other words, to the objects and conditions which impelled
them to the undertaking. The indolent and cowardly
are not attracted by dangers, and hence we infer
that volunteers make better soldiers than conscripts, and
this inference is borne out by experience. Enterprises
of great danger, forlorn hopes, are not chosen by those
who love ease and quiet pleasure, but by the courageous
and venturesome; those who take pleasure in overcoming
resistance, surmounting obstacles, and braving dangers.
The former are inclined to remain upon the old homestead,
under the protection of law and the restraining
influence of conservative public opinion; the latter push
for the frontier, with apparent relish for the kind of life
found only on the fretful edge of civilization. Some have
assumed, therefore, that the borders are chiefly peopled
by the reckless and immoral, those who would not be
subject to proper restraint in the older communities;
such an assumption, however, is wide of the mark. Under
our flag there are no penal colonies; people go where
they choose to go, and the currents of population are determined
by self-selection. Places of trial and danger
are taken by those who are not dismayed by such incidents,
and unless we are willing to admit that there is a
necessary connection between courage and criminality&mdash;that
the enterprising and resolute are as a consequence
tinctured with immoral tendencies&mdash;we shall believe
what is more reasonable and in full accord with our experience,
that the manly virtues are quite compatible
with the moral attributes. I lived on the frontier, the
Platte Purchase in Missouri, right among the people
who contributed in men and money to the invasion of
Kansas a few years afterwards, and I must say that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
never lived in a more hospitable and law-abiding community.
The forceful faculties were more prominent
than in New England, but for personal honor, honesty,
and brotherly feeling it would compare favorably with
any portion of the United States. I had left that country
when the Kansas troubles began, and was somewhat puzzled
to reconcile the doings of the Border Ruffians with
the character of the people as I knew them, but when I
considered that a large majority of them were from the
South, and, being born to the institution of slavery, were
inheritors of all that such a state of society implies, I
ceased to wonder.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the great advance in biological science,
the human being is very much of an enigma, and,
however well disposed he may be from natural endowment,
we can not guess what he may do until his previous
environment has been examined. Suppose John
Brown had been born and raised in the South, and had
read his Bible through Southern spectacles, and had
heard the Word expounded by devout defenders of the
patriarchal institution, would he not have been found
praying and fighting with Stonewall Jackson when the
time came for war?</p>

<p>A large proportion of the pioneers were from Missouri,
and at the time of the adoption of our constitution, which
submitted the question of slavery to a popular vote, much
solicitude was felt by anti-slavery men as to the result.
Argument and inquiry were on the wing, and there was
eminent opportunity, not only to learn the opinions and
wishes of men but how those opinions and wishes came
to be formed. Some of the ablest and best advocates of
a free state were from the South and some of those who
voted to fasten the relic of barbarism upon this free soil
were from the North. One solid, earnest, but uneducated
free state man, born and raised in Kentucky, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
a resident of Missouri for several years just before coming
to the Oregon Territory, was asked as to the evolution of
his opinion and answered "that when living in his native
State, a doubt as to the rightfulness of slavery had never
crossed his mind; that he regarded abolitionists the
same as horse thieves, and would have meted out to them
the same punishment; that when he got to northern
Missouri, where there were but few slaves, he was struck
with the difference he felt and saw, as respects social
conditions; people were more on an equality; that conservative
deference paid to slaveholders was conspicuous
by its absence, and when he got to Oregon, the spirit of
abolitionism was in the air." He thought that if the
good people of Kentucky could experience what he had
they would clear slavery from that state in a year. I
was intimately acquainted with that man for thirty years,
and I am confident that I never saw one more honest and
truthful, or one more ready to assist in reforms or more
willing to be informed. Ignorance was his sin, as it was
of the majority of those subject to the malign influence
of slavery, and yet in his native State he was a possible
border ruffian. What an honest, earnest man believes to
be right he will defend, and for his convictions there is
always a higher law to which he will appeal, notwithstanding
the limitations of statutes and constitutions.</p>

<p>Though a Webster might lose himself in adoration of
the Federal Union and an Everett offer up his mother a
living sacrifice to preserve it, it is to the credit of human
nature that human rights, human interests, human convictions
and affections stand nearer and dearer to the
people than any mere machinery of human government.
The abolitionists believed the Constitution of the United
States was a covenant with Death and a league with Hell,
and they protested with all their soul and strength; to
those Southerners reared to believe in the divinity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
slavery, the Constitution was a worthless rag, for it did
not protect them in their supposed rights. To the men
of earnest convictions on both sides we owe our present
disenthrallment.</p>

<p>The foregoing apparent digression has been indulged
for the reason that the Oregon people were severely criticised
and denounced in connection with our Indian wars,
spoilation claims, and the votes cast in favor of slavery
upon the adoption of our free constitution; and also for
the reason that the aspect of character has a sociological
bearing.</p>

<p>Advanced evolutionists include with their scientific shibboleth,
"the survival of the fittest," an ethical element,
when applied to civilized society. The early settlements
here were singularly free from transgressors. There was
no criminal code and no courts of law up to the time of
the provisional government. Every man was a law unto
himself, and it is said there was no offense against person
or property of sufficient importance to require them.
These were halcyon days, often referred to by old Oregonians,
who say that crime and criminals were unknown
until society was put under the tantalizing reign of law.
I have heard not a few, in referring to the good old times,
express the opinion that mankind are governed too much
by statute and thereby released, in a great degree, from
moral restraint.</p>

<p>There is occasionally an old settler so impressed with
pioneer equality, fraternity, and purity, that he lays all
subsequent social disturbance to the provoking interference
of legal machinery with natural rights, and he
longs "for a lodge in some vast wilderness" where he can
end his days in peace, away from penalties and penal
institutions and the temptations which civil government
offers to the predatory instincts of men.</p>

<p>Such logical metonomy is not mentioned here except to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
show that the pioneers were lovers of peace and good
order, and fully subject to enlightened moral restraint.
As before mentioned, they were peculiar in one respect,
that is, in the possession of a large share of the executive
or heroic qualities.</p>

<p>The Great American Desert, with its sand stretches,
waterless wastes, unbridged rivers, Rocky Mountains, and
predatory savages, loomed up deterrently to the spiritless.
A four to six months' journey in wagons, exposed to all
the vicissitudes of travel and climate and the forays of
more dreadful foes, ever on the alert to dispossess travelers
of their only means of conveyance, was not to be
considered a pleasure trip.</p>

<p>No doubt that to a certain but undefinable extent and
in numerous ways, the circumstances and incidents to be
expected on the overland journey were selective, and yet
the Oregon Pioneer, as pictured by his eulogists, is rather
a fanciful personage. Not that the incidents from which
the picture is drawn are to any unusual degree false, but
that there is too much of the commonplace left out, and
so the typical pioneer, like the typical Yankee, is a caricature.
The pioneers, as a body, were only a little different
from those who were too affectionate or diffident
to start, and among them were all sorts of people; but
looking only to those who endured extraordinary privations,
to those who developed an uncommon degree of
strength, courage, and virtue, there have grown up the
poetry and romance of the pioneers, and to none is this
more evident than the pioneers themselves. At one of
their annual gatherings, when an eloquent speaker was
narrating the trying incidents of the overland journey,
one of the earlier immigrants inquisitively remarked "I
wonder if I ever crossed the plains?" I was querying the
same; still we must not neglect to state that the speaker
was dealing in facts. He was leaving out so much that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
those who had passed the ordeal wondered if they had
ever been there. Indeed, the speakers and writers who
have been called to the task of perpetuating pioneer history
have had the usual inducements to false coloring,
which has been the curse of all history in all times.</p>

<p>Striking incidents, battles, sieges, marches, insurrections,
revolutions, and the leading actors in them, of such
is the warp and woof of history, until man is understood
to be a mere fighting animal, although the greater part
of his life has been spent in peaceful avocations and the
greater exertion of his force and faculties has been devoted
to constructive industry.</p>

<p>Out of such partiality has inevitably grown the great
man theory of human progression. The student of history
passes along from point to point in the bloody trail
of the historian, stopping at such characters as Alexander,
Cæsar, Charlemagne, Napoleon, etc., until these
great destroyers are looked upon as the prime factors of
the evolutionary state. Of course, these and such as these
must not be ignored or left out, for history would cease
to be history without them, but it is equally important
to know that man, judged only by them, ceases to be
man. Of late an improved philosophy of history assigns
them their proper place and significance as an index of
evolution, and gives us the hopeful sign that notwithstanding
the occasional irruption of man's destructive faculties,
his progress is principally due to the subordination
of the militant spirit. And now, while the principal
part of our early history, territorial and state, is devoted
to our really insignificant Indian wars and the principal
characters on both sides, it is well enough to think that
the greater constructive works of peace have been going
forward with hardly a halt, and the more sober tints are
yet to be given the picture of early Oregon times.</p>

<p>With such coloring as we now have of pioneer life and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
the passage of the great plains, posterity will wonder, as
did the pioneer before quoted, if the pioneers ever did
cross, and also what kind of people they must have been
to undertake, with such slender means, so perilous a
journey. Samuel R. Thurston, Oregon's first delegate
under the Territorial Government, advertised his constituents
as "fellows who could whip their weight in wildcats,"
very good electioneering taffy, no doubt, but
rather strong and really degrading language to apply to
the earnest men and women who so patiently toiled to
the Northwest coast.</p>

<p>Of a higher type and tone was the poetical exaggeration
"only the brave started, only the strong got through."
The facts are different. Some arrant cowards and many
more physically weak persons, by some sufficient means,
found their way here. The emigrant train was not a forlorn
hope; no such test was made for membership.
Neither was it a test of patriotism; albeit every citizen
is a quixotic propagator of his republican faith. Various
were the inducements in the minds of those who left the
older states for the Pacific Slope. Many, like ex-Senator
Nesmith, did not really know, as they had no well defined
purpose, but might answer in his language, and with
probable truth, that they were "impelled by a vague spirit
of adventure." Restless spirits are always ready for
any move, promising unusual scope for the exercise of
their faculties. Many were along to enjoy the exhilaration
of travel, in a new, strange, and truly wonderful
country. Many, long wasted by the miasmatic fevers of
the overrich and productive Mississippi Valley, sought
immunity in the untainted mountain air of the Far West.
A few of the Daniel Boone stripe were too much crowded
where inhabitants exceeded one to the square mile, and
took one more move with the hope that the hum drum of
civilization would never overtake them. A few of a poetical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
turn of mind, tired of the monotony of the greater
East, sought fresh inspiration and a home upon the picturesque
shores of the sunset seas.</p>

<p>But while all of the foregoing and many other inducements
might have been present in varying degree, the
great incentive to immigration was free land. Not only
land for the landless, but land for all, and in unstinted
quantity. The scenes at Oklahoma divest the emigration
to Oregon of all mystery, and while there was probably
small difference in kind or degree of virtue between those
who came and those who remained, of one fact pioneers
are cognizant, namely, that the incidents and trials of
the overland journey were a wonderful developer and
equalizer. The fictitious gloss of so-called society was
abraded, and the shams of character in which human
beings had invested themselves, like weakly oxen, were
left on the road. Everywhere this is observable, and it
is often remarked that the true pioneer is never afterward
subject to an undue self-inflation. It seems as though a
few months' practice of sincere brotherhood is fatal to an
offensive amount of arrogance and egotism.</p>

<p>Now let us inquire as to the use and the tenacity of hold
the pioneers had for their unbought possessions. There
was no sign of indolence on their part upon arriving.
The same pushing qualities which enabled them to surmount
all difficulties in getting here were not wanting
when homes were to be made and farms to be cultivated.
To all appearances the older community, with an infusion
of vigor born of success and adventure, had been
transplanted upon virgin soil. Of necessity population
was sparse. In large districts, principally settled by
immigrants before 1851, there was but one family to the
square mile, and in other portions were those arriving
afterwards and settling two to the square mile. In this
way a few people cover, or rather appropriate, a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
country, and their improvements, though considerable,
appear very meager. Every thing, however, was at
hand; rail timber ten cuts to the tree; cedar for shingles
and shakes; poles straight enough for rafters without
hewing, and fir trees, seemingly grown for the special
purpose of house frames. The soil was favorable. Though
producing a good growth of the most nutritious native
grass, it was easily plowed, two good horses being sufficient
to turn over two acres of sod in a day, and, unlike
the sward in other countries, was mellow from the first
harrowing. Many a family coming as late as October
plowed and fenced forty acres and raised from twelve
hundred to sixteen hundred bushels of wheat the next
harvest, working their cattle that hauled them across the
plains and feeding them nothing but the bunch grass
upon which they pastured through the winter months.</p>

<p>After the discovery of gold in California, the market
for all farm products was at almost every man's door and
at marvelous prices. Butter from fifty cents to a dollar
a pound; bacon from twenty-five to fifty cents a pound;
chickens from $5 to $10 per dozen; eggs from twenty-five
to fifty cents per dozen; sheep from $5 to $12 per head;
cows, $50; horses, $200; oxen from $100 to $200 per
yoke; wheat from $1 to $7 per bushel, and labor from
$2 to $5 per day. Of course, such prices gradually wore
down, but the opportunity for large profits in farming
and stock raising continued for a quarter of a century.
Our public disbursements, however, were not on the
same scale. Up to the year 1859 Uncle Sam paid a good
share of the governmental expenses, and at that time
our state government was organized under a constitution
that has often been called parsimonious.</p>

<p>The sixteenth and thirty-sixth sections of each township,
or lands in lieu thereof, were devoted by Congress
to common schools; land was also given to found a state
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
university and agricultural college, and five hundred
thousand acres along with five per cent of the sales of
public lands were given to an internal improvement fund
to be used by the state. Add to this the swamp lands,
amounting to several hundred thousand acres of the most
valuable, all given without cost, and one might well ask,
"in the name of common sense what more should a paternal
government do for a people?" And yet it has done
more. Coast defenses and lighthouses have been built,
the rivers dredged, harbors improved, something near a
million dollars appropriated to cut a canal around the
cascade falls, and military roads and posts established
to protect our inhabitants from the aborigines.</p>

<p>In common with all the other inhabitants of the United
States, we have been suffering for the last few years from
an aggravating increase of our great American industry,
politics, but until the discovery was made, that people
can grow rich by taxing themselves, the people of Oregon
were contented with small levies for public purposes.
Indeed, we have done little in the way of public improvements
to create expense. With the exception of county
roads, which are mainly ungraded dirt ways, and the
bridging of streams, nothing of importance has been
attempted.</p>

<p>In view of all the foregoing comes the sharp contrast
of the present condition of the pioneers and their immediate
descendants. In the absence of any reliable census
reports, I have been obliged to rely upon regional inspection,
taking a township here and there and tracing up
the career of the first white inhabitants. For this purpose
I have selected, for an average, one hundred square
miles on the east side of the Willamette Valley, in Marion
County, which contains the state capital, and an examination
shows that sixty-six per cent of the donation claims
have passed out of the possession of the donees and their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
descendants, another fifteen per cent are mortgaged for
all they are worth, and for practical purposes may be considered
as lost to them. Not more than fifteen per cent
of the whole have been ordinarily successful in holding
and improving a part of their possessions and are now
free from debt. Only five of all of them have increased
their holdings and are thrifty. Eighty-seven per cent
held section claims, and it may be mentioned that the
half-section claimants were more successful in holding
their own, and add very much to the favorableness of
this report. In the better part of this county, a hundred
square miles in a body might be selected where the per
cent of loss would be greater, but this was settled chiefly
by French, Scotch, and English Canadians, mountain
men and trappers of nomadic habits, who married Indian
women of the whole or half-breed, and of whose descendants
less is expected, as they are passionately fond of
ardent spirits. A teetotaler of mixed blood would be a
rare sight. Neighborly, clever people, of lax business
habits, and of necessity trustful, they were soon beat out of
their landed possessions. Probably in no American community
has the credit system been so much in vogue as
on this Northwest coast, and likely for the reason that in
no other place are crops so sure, and certainly in no other
place was a broad basis of credit so much at the disposal
of debtors. A family with a section of land that produces
unfailing crops at small cost, can get credit anywhere;
and what a harvest it has been for merchants and middlemen
in these western valleys until recently. Ah, man!
you are, indeed, a wanting animal, one whose wants are
ever multiplying and exacting. Only a few of the race
are securely provident by immediate self-denial, and this
truth applies equally to the pioneers, those resolute men
and women&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Who kept step with the patient ox,</p>
<p>And toiled by the rolling wheel,</p>
<p>Drew success from the sand and rocks,</p>
<p>As sparks from the flint and steel.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The heads of families did not so readily depart from
their early habits of economy, but the children soon reveled
in their magnificent possessions. Girls and boys
alike became semi-nomads, or properly speaking, fell
into the ways of the baronial English or the planter class
of the South. As a consequence of their newly found
competence and leisure "they took to horse," and strange,
what a fascination comes over a human being when he
takes to horse. In truth, that boy who did not admire
the splendid aboriginal equestrians of the Great Plains
and get filled with the spirit of the wild and free, as he
saw them scurrying along the mountain side or sweeping
down into the valley with the speed of the wind; that
boy must have been an unchangeable clodhopper or a
born philosopher.</p>

<p>Very few of them escaped the uncivilizing contamination,
and many a youth, fresh from an unfinished course
at school, had his book education cut sadly short by bestriding
a cayuse and becoming a practical cowboy. The
infatuation was not confined to the boys. The girls, too,
had as much fondness for the noble brute, and were as
expert and graceful in his management. Some of them
have ridden seventy-five miles in a day. As a means of
social communication at that time it had no equal; and
for stock raising and the round-up in such a country,
the horseman was unapproachable. Still, with all such
advantages, and they were many, which could have been
turned into permanent profit, the cowboy generation,
though having a "heap of fun," and no doubt genuine
pleasure, let the earth slip from under his feet. How
could it be otherwise? Who could deny them? A party
of boys and girls on their favorite steeds, the former in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
leggings, bell spurs, and the graceful sirrapa; the latter
in the freshness of physical beauty and bedecked with
flowing skirts and scarlet streaming sash&mdash;when such a
cavalcade went galloping over the prairies with a speed
that put to shame a Sheridan's ride, what parent could
or would deny them.</p>

<p>Well, the parents did not deny them this and other diversions
from gainful industry, and, little by little, the
princely donations of land went into the till of the shopkeeper
or the safe of the money changer. Landless and
moneyless, they scattered over the country, and, as it
were, dropped into all kinds of callings. Many of them
have gone east of the Cascades and taken homesteads and
pre-emptions in the arid regions, and there upon the
bunch grass lands have gained a living and some a competence
by stock raising and wool growing. Others followed
up the streams into the mountains and in some
narrow valley made a home away from the every day
temptations of the lowlanders. Others went to the coast.
Many of the young have found ample success in other
avocations and do not regret the loss of the parental donations.
They are found on the bench, at the bar, in the
pulpit, in the governmental employ, in college faculties,
and in all honorable pursuits. Only a few have ignobly
failed, and those few do not invalidate the maxim that
"where there is a will there is a way" for falling into
the drink habit they lost their wills.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I am not willing to assert that the policy
of the general government, in donating land as a reward
for taking possession of this Northwest coast, was not
a wise policy or that it was an injury to the donees,
though in the main they failed to keep the gift, but the
lesson is none the less valuable; and what is it but a
confirmation of the general truth that "necessity is the
mother of invention," the spur to exertion, and that success
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
in this life is to be obtained only through the school
of experience as the reward of continued and temperate
effort. As there is no royal road to knowledge so there
is no royal road to wealth or any other valuable acquisition;
and it is not proper to confine this edict of fate to
mere material things, although to be fed and clothed is
the first and most imperious demand of nature. Man
in all of his successful undertakings is an evolutionary
being. Whether intellectually, morally, or physically
considered, he keeps best what he has produced, what he
has earned. As a hard and fast donee, he is not a success;
as a beggar, he is disgusting even to himself.
Sometimes he needs charity, but always justice.</p>

<h3>GLIMPSES OF EARLY DAYS IN
OREGON.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>It would be difficult, indeed, to find anything new to
say of pioneering or pioneers, and useless to trace the
pioneers along their journey across the Plains. We will
pass over an interval of eight months and introduce our
loved fathers and mothers on their arrival at where Portland
now stands.</p>

<p>On the first of November, 1845, after a journey of eight
months of inconceivable hardships, a small party of those
pioneers first stepped on the banks of the grand Willamette
River, near where Morrison Street is now located.
The rays of the setting sun casting their light and shade
o'er the beautiful landscape, impressed the beholders
with a deep feeling of thankfulness that they were permitted
to reach the new land, and stand on the shore of
the wonderful river of the west. The wind murmuring
through the branches of the stately fir bade them welcome,
and the old trees served as shelter for the next two
months. With the aid of flint, steel, and powder, a
large camp fire was soon burning brightly, casting a rich
glow o'er the magnificent wall of forest trees. It was a
picturesque scene. The soft moonlight, the sparkle of
the water, the lurid light from the resinous fire, formed
a scene worthy of a painter's skill. They sat around the
fire for hours reveling in the luxury of rest; and they
arrived destitute in all save character, determination, and
self-reliance. With such sterling qualities failure was
impossible.</p>

<p>The little company did not retire early, as they were
forming plans for their future work. At a late hour buffalo
robes and blankets were spread on the ground, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
soon all were lost in sleep. The only sound that broke
the silence was the yelp of the prowling coyote.</p>

<p>With the first rosy blushes of the dawn the men began
to rise, and before the sun was fairly over the horizon
the sound and echoes of their axes brought cheer to our
mothers' hearts, for they knew ere long homes would
shelter them from the winter's storms. Weeks of hard
labor were required to fell the trees, and clear away the
brush, and prepare the site on which to build. Trees
were cut the proper length, one side of the log hewed
smooth with a broadax, and fitted so they would join at
the corners and lie compact. It was no easy task, but
our loved pioneers, with only a saw, auger and ax, broadaxe
and adze would put to shame some of the more modern
workmen. Logs for the puncheon floors were split
and smoothed with an adze, and fitted close together,
making a warm and solid floor. The structure raised to
a proper height, poles were used for rafters; some of the
logs were cut three feet in length, from which shakes
were made and used in place of shingles. The fireplace
and chimney was built with sticks and plastered inside
and out with a thick coating of clay. Some had a stout
iron bar securely fastened on one side of the large fireplace;
on this bar, which was called a crane, iron hooks
were placed, on which the teakettle and other cooking
utensils were hung; all cooking and baking was done
before the open fire and broad clay hearth. Windows
were a sort of sliding door in the wall, without glass.
The furniture was extremely simple, being split out of fir
or cedar trees, and, if not elegant, was substantial;
doors were also made of shakes, and hung on wooden
hinges. Wooden pegs were used in place of nails. Rough
bedsteads were placed in one corner of the large room,
the trundle bed pushed under it during the day, and at
night drawn out ready for the little ones. For one to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
see the number of sweet faces and bright eyes of the
many children lying in their beds, the scene would put
the old woman who lived in her shoe far in the minority.
Large quantities of moss stripped from the trees made
good mattresses; with buffalo robes and blankets they
had comfortable beds. Their primitive cabins completed
ready for occupancy, with heartfelt thankfulness they
left the shelter of the trees for their first Oregon home.</p>

<p>The latchstring, like a welcome hand, bade them enter.
A bright fire greeted them with her golden rays and
warmth, and the sound of the teakettle, cheerily singing,
they catch the glad refrain and quickly joined with&mdash;</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Home! Home! sweet, sweet home!</p>
<p>Be it ever so humble,</p>
<p>There's no place like home."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>How well they realized the true meaning of home, as no
roof had sheltered them for the past ten months. As the
family gathered around the ruddy light of the cheerful
fire, which was their only light, plans were made to visit
Oregon City for supplies of food and clothing. Indians,
with their canoes, conveyed them to their destination.
Soon wheat, bolts of flannel, with other necessary articles,
were purchased and shipped; fathers stepped on board,
and the trusty Indian with a stroke of the paddle sent the
frail craft swiftly gliding o'er limpid water. Ere long
they were rushing over the Clackamas rapids, which in
hurried haste, flows on and yet is never gone. As the
sun was sinking behind the hills, they reached home,
where the anxious mother, blinded by tears of gladness,
thanked God for the much needed supply of clothing and
wheat, which was their only bread. Deer and other game
were plentiful, and easily brought down by their trusty
rifle. Salmon was bought of the Indians. Ducks, geese,
and swan were numerous. All winter mothers were kept
busy cutting and making clothing for the entire household;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
also teaching their daughters how to sew, knit,
and attend to general housework; and if mothers were
sick they did the work with willing hands. The canoe
and bateaux were their only means of transportation.
Neighbors would surprise the family by bringing their
violins, and spending the evening talking and dancing.
The large room would be cleared of all furniture, which
was placed in the loft where the small children were put
to bed; soon the merry sound of tripping feet were keeping
time to Money Musk, and other old time music, the
old men talked over the possibilities of Oregon. One
thought bridges would span the Willamette; others shook
their heads, saying not while we live. Our children may
live to see one. Others thought railroads would be built
across the continent; all looked at the speaker and echoed
"A railroad! Never, over those mountains. Why, man,
no one in God's world will live to see that day. Steamers
and ships will come, but no railroad."</p>

<p>Our pioneer mothers made their dresses with plain
skirts; waists were sewed onto the skirt; sleeves were
much like those worn by the women of to-day. Their
hair was combed smooth by their forehead and wound in
a coil high on their head, many wore side combs, a high
back comb held their coil of glossy hair. Hairpins were
an unknown luxury. White handkerchiefs were worn
in place of collars, and they looked very pretty crossed
or tied in a bow at the throat. All were deft with the
needle, also weaving; those who have the rare blue and
gray counterpanes, manufactured by their willing hands,
possess an heirloom of great value.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1846 gardens were made by those living
on farms, from which early vegetables were procured, and
in the fall many bushels of potatoes, pease, and other
vegetables were stored; of summer fruit there were wild
strawberries, and later raspberries and blackberries, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
which large quantities were picked and dried; also hazel
bushes, producing nuts in abundance, which were gathered
and stored for winter use. There was not much
buying and selling, except of wheat, which was used as
currency, as well as for food. Portland was founded in
1845 by pioneers who were quick to see the magnitude
and resources of the country. J. B. Stephens, who was
a cooper, saw the large revenue to be made by exporting
salmon, and soon began making barrels and kegs, from
which he netted a large profit. The first tannery built
in Portland was erected near where the exposition building
is located, by D. H. Lownesdale, who had the honor
of introducing a new circulating medium, which was
Oregon tanned leather.</p>

<p>In 1845 the first ferry from the east bank to the west
shore was a canoe.</p>

<p>In 1845 Portland was named.</p>

<p>In 1846 the first blacksmith shop was erected on the
northwest corner of First and Morrison streets.</p>

<p>In 1847 H. Luelling brought the first grafted fruit trees
to the Northwest. His famous nursery was located near
Milwaukie.</p>

<p>In 1847 Captain Crosby built the first frame house;
others soon followed. Hotels, stores, and business houses
were also erected. At that time the United States mail
arrived yearly.</p>

<p>In 1848 the first Methodist Church was organized in
Portland, and a church building was begun by J. H.
Wilbur; doing good for others was his greatest pleasure.
Blessed be his name!</p>

<p>In 1850 the first Congregational Church was erected
on the northwest corner of Second and Jefferson streets.
The oldest Congregational Church in Oregon was organized
in 1842 at or near Hillsboro. The second was organized
in 1844 at Oregon City by Harvey Clark, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
three members; he also organized the first Congregational
Church in Forest Grove; his many golden words
and good examples are his living monument.</p>

<p>In 1849 Colonel William King built the first sawmill
ever built in Portland, which was run by water power.
Soon after it was finished it was destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>In 1850 W. P. Abrams and C. A. Reed erected the first
steam sawmill in Oregon on the river bank near where
Jefferson Street is located. This proved a profitable enterprise.
Just south of the mill was an Indian encampment,
occupied by different tribes. Their wigwams were
constructed of bark and brush. Squaws sat on mats,
weaving their water tight baskets, often very prettily
decorated, while the Indian men lounged about in scarlet
blankets, as if posing for a picture, and their children
sat in their canoes gliding o'er the water with swanlike
grace. Information had been circulated among them
that the mill would be started up on a certain afternoon,
and all were curious to see the working of this new evidence
of the white man's superiority. At the stated
time the Indians were in and around the mill; suddenly
the steam whistle sounded its shrill shrieks in a continuous
blood curdling blast, which sent every Indian man,
woman and child fleeing for their lives into the dense
woods. It was a long time before they could be induced
to go near the mill.</p>

<p>In 1847, 1848, and 1849 many emigrants arrived who
settled in Portland, adding thrift and push to our small
colony. The discovery of gold in California on the
twenty-fourth of January, 1848, caused Portland to look
like a deserted hamlet, as all men and boys caught the
gold fever and started for the golden shores of California,
where many were killed by the Digger Indians;
others died of various diseases, and some returned home
broken in health, while others returned with their hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
earned gold. Ships arrived yearly in Oregon with supplies
for the Hudson Bay Company, by way of the Sandwich
Islands.</p>

<p>In 1849 twenty vessels arrived, and quickly loaded
with flour, salmon, pork, shingles, lumber, and other
products, which they carried to the California market.
From that time Portland began laying aside her swaddling
clothes. The first mayor of Portland was Hugh
D. O'Bryant, who was elected in 1851. When the city
was incorporated it was in Washington County, and the
people from Portland had to go to Hillsboro to hold court.
In 1856 a meeting of the citizens of Portland was called
to organize a volunteer company to protect the people
and property, in case of an Indian outbreak; two hundred
names were enrolled and H. W. Davis was appointed
captain.</p>

<p>In 1850 the steamer Lot Whitcombe was built at Milwaukie,
Oregon. In 1851 the steamers Eagle and Black
Hawk were running between Portland and Oregon City,
where those who wished to proceed farther south, would
walk to Canemah and there board the steamer Beaver or
Enterprise which would convey them to any of these
points: Butteville, Champoeg, Mission Bottom, or Salem.
Steamers Belle and Fashion were running between Portland
and the Cascades.</p>

<p>In 1853 David Monnastes and H. W. Davis erected a
foundry on First Street. Many other industries were
established.</p>

<p>Among the pioneer doctors were Doctors Hawthorne and
Lorrea, who erected the first hospital on Taylor, between
First and Second streets. Soon after they selected a
beautiful location in East Portland, surrounded by forest
trees, and erected a home for the insane.</p>

<p>In 1853 W. S. Ladd built the first brick building in
Portland. Others soon followed, and frame houses were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
now in evidence, and the log cabin in which so many
happy hours were spent around the great fireside was
fast disappearing, although built from necessity, not
choice&mdash;happy memories of it still linger which time can
not efface.</p>

<p>In 1850 several families left Portland to reside on their
donation land claims. I will describe one of these homes:
A frame house with large rooms, papered, and woodwork
painted, glass windows, sitting room with a large brick
fireplace, with a mantle of oak, easy chairs, a large
mirror, table, and a corner cupboard filled with dishes.
The kitchen was furnished with a cook stove and all
other necessary articles. Feather beds were now in use.
This house was erected near the bank of the ever beautiful
Willamette. On the west a creek glided in sparkling
beauty by the kitchen door, supplying the household
with cold mountain water. Memory loves to recall
those scenes. In a garden early vegetables and a variety
of flower seeds were growing. A large frame barn
stood on the hill, with pigpen and chicken house close
by; a woodshed filled with wood stood near the back
gate. In the fall, when it was time to garner the wheat,
oats, or hay, neighbors, bringing their scythes and other
instruments used to mow the harvest, would surprise the
farmer at early dawn, saying, "Well, neighbor, I have
come to help you with your harvesting;" and they never
left until the bountiful crop had been garnered. The
golden rule, do unto others as you would have them do
unto you, was lived and practiced and represents to us
that period in our social system when a neighborhood
was as one great family.</p>

<p>In 1849 a mint was erected in Oregon City to coin five- and
ten-dollar gold pieces, which were known as beaver
money.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1849 a party of Oregonians, embarked on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
a sailing vessel, left California for Portland. The captain
proved to be a most unkind and brutal master, not
only to the sailors but to the passengers, who were compelled
to eat the worst of food. After sailing for twenty-two
days they encountered a violent gale, and were driven
out of their course. As they were nearing the Columbia-river
bar the vessel was drawn into the breakers at North
Beach and was deserted by captain, crew, and passengers,
who in their haste to save themselves forgot their gold.
On reaching shore they were exhausted and were obliged
to walk around the entire night to keep from freezing.
In the early morning they saw smoke a short distance
up the beach. Each man hurried to the scene. They
found a comfortable house where they were made to feel
at home in true pioneer style by the owner, a Mr. Johnson,
who was, as all Scotchmen are, loyal and hospitable.
As they were in a weakened condition the good man gave
them a small quantity of food at first, which was fish
cooked on the point of a stick held before the fire. All
agreed that was the best food they had ever eaten. Now
they related their hardships encountered on the voyage.
Mr. Johnson sent out his Indians with instructions to
reach the wreck and bring everything available ashore.
This order seemed scarcely possible, but the brave Indians
went through the breakers, reaching the vessel,
and before night brought all the sacks of gold dust and
many articles of wearing apparel ashore, where each man
could claim his own. The party remained several days
with their benefactor, who kindly conveyed them to
Astoria.</p>

<p>In 1854 Thomas Fraser was the first to agitate the
public school question. The following public spirited
men were present: Thomas Fraser, W. S. Ladd, Josiah
Failing, H. W. Corbett, P. Raleigh, A. D. Shelby, T. N.
Larkin, A. L. Davis, C. Abrams, L. Limerick. All of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
these noble and unselfish men, except one, have passed
on to their higher home&mdash;H. W. Corbett, the surviving
one, a pioneer of 1851, loved, honored, and justly called
the Father of Portland, is still the first to give his time
and money for the betterment and upbuilding of the city
and state. God grant that he may be spared many,
many more years. No monument need be erected to
their memory. The nobility of their lifework is woven
and cemented deeply in the hearts of the people.</p>

<p>December, 1855, Multnomah County was organized.
In January following L. Limerick was appointed county
school superintendent. December 4, 1850, the first weekly
<i>Oregonian</i> was published in Portland by T. J. Dryer. In
1851 the first regular monthly mail service began between
Portland and San Francisco, per steamer Columbia.</p>

<p>Before Oregon was admitted to the Union in 1859 the
log cabins had been cleared away, showing the pioneers
were progressive.</p>

<p>In 1858 C. Stewart erected the first theatre building in
Portland.</p>

<p><i>Wilcox School</i>&mdash;The first day school of any kind was
opened in Portland in the fall of 1847, by Dr. Ralph
Wilcox. It was conducted in a house erected by Mr.
McNemee at the foot of Taylor Street. It was properly
a private school and continued one quarter. The names
of some of the pupils are given: Frances McNemee (now
Mrs. E. J. Northup), her brothers Moses, Adam, and
William; Charlotte Terwilliger (now Mrs. C. M. Cartwright),
Milton Doan's children&mdash;Sarah, Mary, Peter
and John, Henry Hill, Helen Hill (now Mrs. Wm. Powell),
J. Miller,&mdash;Murphy, Lucy and Charlotte Barnes,
Emma and Sarah Ross, Lorenzo Terwilliger, and John
Terwilliger. Doctor Wilcox came to Oregon in 1845.</p>

<p><i>Carter School</i>&mdash;In February, 1848, Miss Julia Carter
taught school in a log cabin on the corner of Second and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Stark streets. She had thirty or more pupils. Those
who attended Doctor Wilcox's school, also these additional:
John Cullen, Carrie Polk, the Warren girls&mdash;one
now Mrs. Richard White, the other Mrs. D. C. Coleman;
Milton, John, Albert, Matilda, and Susan Apperson,
were her pupils.</p>

<p><i>Hyde School</i>&mdash;In the winter of 1848 and 1849, Aaron
J. Hyde taught school in what was known as the Cooper
shop, which was the only public hall in Portland. It was
located on the west side of First Street, between Morrison
and Yamhill streets.</p>

<p><i>Lyman School</i>&mdash;Late in December, 1849, Rev. Horace
Lyman opened a school in a frame building, which was
built by Col. Wm. King for church and school purposes.
It was located on First Street, second door north of Oak.
On this building was placed a bell, which weighed about
three hundred pounds. Stephen Coffin bought this bell
at his own expense. Rev. Jas. H. Wilbur bought the
bell of Mr. Coffin and placed it on the First Methodist
Church. It now hangs in the steeple of the Taylor-street
M. E. Church. He taught three months, had forty pupils.
Among his pupils he recalls the Coffins, Chapmans, Parrishes,
Kings, Hills, Terwilligers, Appersons, Watts, and
McNemees.</p>

<p><i>Delos Jefferson School</i>&mdash;In August, 1850, Delos Jefferson,
now a farmer of Marion County, opened a school
and taught three months.</p>

<p><i>Reed School</i>&mdash;In April, 1850, Cyrus A. Reed taught
school for three months. He had an average of sixty
pupils. Among his pupils he recalls the names, Carters,
Cullen, Coffin, Hill, Chapman, Terwilliger, Parrishes,
Stephens, McNemee, and Watts. There was no other
district organization.</p>

<p><i>Rev. Doane's School</i>&mdash;Following Mr. Jefferson, came
Rev. N. Doane, then and now a minister of the M. E.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Church. He taught nine months, beginning December
1, 1850. To the former lists of pupils he adds Davises,
Crosbys, Lownesdale, and Parrishes.</p>

<p><i>Central School</i>&mdash;The Central School occupied the present
site of the Portland Hotel. Monday, May 18, 1858,
the first school in the Central Building was opened by
L. L. Terwilliger, principal, with two assistants, Mrs.
Mary J. Hensill and Owen Connelly. From the records
I find that up to July 23, 1858, two hundred and eighty
different pupils had been enrolled. The names of pupils,
parents, and residences are on record. Of all the residences
noted, but two were west of Seventh Street. Those
two were F. M. Warren and Wm. H. King. Most of the
residences were on First, Second, Third, and Fourth
streets, with quite a number in Couch's Addition. Mr.
Terwilliger was principal of the Central School for two
and a quarter years.</p>

<p><i>Bishop Scott's Academy</i>&mdash;Was opened in the spring of
1856, at Milwaukie.</p>

<p><i>Saint Mary's Academy</i>&mdash;The oldest denominational
school in Portland, was founded in 1859 by the Sisters of
the Most Holy Name of Jesus and Mary. The first Catholic
Church in Oregon was erected in 1839 at Saint Paul,
Marion County.</p>

<p>In 1849 a Catholic Church was dedicated in Oregon
City.</p>

<p>In 1851 the first Catholic Church was erected in Portland,
and dedicated in 1852 by Archbishop Blanchet, who
labored with zeal to better the condition of all. Peace
to his memory.</p>

<p>In 1845 George Abernethy, who resided in Oregon
City, was chosen to serve as governor of Oregon. He
was a man of sterling qualities and well qualified for the
office, and was a pioneer of 1840. In the fall of 1851
the academy on Seventh and Jefferson streets was opened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
with C. S. Kingsley, teacher. The school was surrounded
by large trees and was a long distance from the village.
No streets were improved near the school. One could
follow the cow path that wound around, and the tinkling
of the cow bell could be heard as late as 1861, when a
law was passed prohibiting cattle from roaming on the
streets.</p>

<h4>GLIMPSE OF ONE OF MANY SIMILAR SCENES
ENDURED OUR LOVED PIONEERS.</h4>

<p>In 1850 Mr. S. M. Hamilton, with his wife and four
children, after a long journey across the Plains arrived
at the Cascades. They were impressed with the towering
mountains and beautiful scenery. Here they decided
to locate on a donation land claim, which is now known
as Hamilton's Island. A comfortable house soon greeted
them. Mrs. Hamilton, who is still with us, is a woman
of culture and refinement, and many owe their success
in life to her loving example and words of cheer; but
dark days were hovering around their peaceful home.
The terrible news that Indians were lurking to plunder
and kill had filled their hearts with terror. Mr. Hamilton
had arranged, if the outbreak did occur, that two men
were to take charge of the boat, while others were to remain
and defend their property. A bateaux lay in readiness.
On the morning of the 26th of March, 1856, the
dreaded signal sounded, striking terror to the stoutest
hearts. Mr. Hamilton hurried to his home, where wife
and children were terrified. His first word was "Mary,
the Yakima Indians have attacked the men, who were
working on the portage railroad, and will soon reach our
home. Your only safety is to embark at once, with other
families, who are hurrying to reach the boat, their only
means of escape." All were now on board except one
woman, who was carrying her babe, and running over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
the rocks as fast as her strength would permit. One of
the men who had charge of the boat said "Push out and
leave her." Mr. Hamilton placed his hand on the boat,
saying, "No, no; never leave man, woman, or child who
is in sight." By this time the woman and child were on
board; quickly the boat was in the swift current, the
occupants were lying on the bottom to escape the whizzing
bullets and arrows of the savages, whose demoniacal
and blood curdling yells added terror to the mothers'
hearts. Picture the agony of those mothers as they were
floating away from loved ones and home, listening to the
frightful shrieks and rapid shooting of the Indians. For
a moment the father watched the receding craft that held
all that was dear&mdash;dearer than life&mdash;not knowing when,
or if ever, they would meet again. With upturned face
he exclaimed "Oh, God, have mercy and protect the dear
ones." A bullet whistled past his head; he raised his
trusty rifle, fired, one Indian fell; again and again his
rifle was reloaded and fired, each time sure of its mark.
That night his house was burned. The Indians were
armed with guns and arrows. They killed one woman
and her husband; several men were killed; after hours
of suspense those in the boat sighted the steamer Fashion.
She quickly halted, taking all on board, turned back,
reaching Vancouver the following day, where the alarm
was sounded, and the steamer hurried on to Portland;
there the bells tolling forth called out the citizens, who,
on hearing the terrible news began collecting guns and
ammunition; the entire population was aroused. Nothing
since the Whitman massacre had brought such sorrow
to their hearts. Early in the morning the steamer,
loaded with human freight, started for the sad scene. A
steamer had left Fort Vancouver with our illustrious
Sheridan, who, with forty men reached the Cascades
first. On landing they received a volley from the Indians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
who fought like demons. Now the steamer arrived with
the Portland volunteers. At the same time Colonel Steptoe,
from The Dalles, with infantry and volunteers,
arrived, who surprised the Indians, many of whom were
horse racing, others were watching Sheridan. As they
saw the new arrival of blue coats, they fled to the hills.
Nine of the ring leaders were captured and hung. To
relate all the thrilling incidents encountered by the early
pioneers would fill volumes, and in conclusion, I feel that
the hallowed remembrances of all our loyal patriotic pioneer
fathers and mothers will live to the end of time, as
they braved dangers that tongue or pen fail to express,
and by their life's work each one has erected their invincible
monument.</p>

<h3>THE UPPER CALAPOOIA.</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Geo. O. Goodall</span>.</p>

<p>The early history of the white man in the Upper Calapooia
was a quiet and uneventful one. The travelers
coming in from their long trip across the Plains, pushed
up the Willamette Valley, and, attracted by the beautiful
and fertile Calapooia Valley, with its abundance of grass
on its surrounding hills, and plentiful supply of water,
settled there to live the peaceful life of farmers or stock
raisers, with very little trouble of any kind to disturb
them in their occupation of home-making. In those
early days the hills, most of which are now heavily
wooded, were free from timber and covered with beautiful
grass. One old settler said: "You can not imagine the
beauty of this country when we first came here." The
Indians had kept the brush burned down, burning over
the hills each year. The white man neglected to do this,
and now in many places the grass has given way to moss
and timber.</p>

<p>According to the best information I could get, the first
settlers came to the Calapooia in 1846. T. A. Riggs,
who came in 1847, and whose statement is appended below,
says that when he came there were three or four
settlers near where Brownsville now stands, and one,
R. C. Finley, six miles up stream. This man Finley was
the settler farthest up the stream till Riggs and his partner,
Asa Moore, took up donation claims two or three
miles above Finley on Brush Creek, a tributary of the
Calapooia. From this time on more settlers came every
year and settled all along the Calapooia Valley and on
streams tributary. The settlement here preceded that
in the upper Willamette to some extent, because out in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
the valley there was less timber, water was less plentiful,
and the soil was not considered as good as in the Calapooia.</p>

<p>Most of the settlers who came were farmers. R. C.
Finley, however, was a millwright, and in 1849<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> built a
flouring mill, which still stands, six miles above Brownsville.
In 1850 Templeton built a sawmill; in 1852 Finley
built one, and in 1854 P. V. Crawford built one near the
present site of Holley. The first settlers had gone to
Oregon City for flour, and later to Salem. After Finley's
mill was built people came from as far away as the
Umpqua Valley to get flour there.</p>

<p>Schools were founded at an early date, the first being
taught by Rev. H. H. Spalding in a log house one mile
above where Brownsville now stands, in the summer of
1849. This was a subscription school. The first district
was organized on the Calapooia in 1853, being the third
district in Linn County. The first school after the district
was organized was taught by Robert Moore in the summer
of 1853. The churches commenced work very soon
and several denominations were represented. Joab Powell,
the celebrated Baptist evangelist, used to preach there,
and gave it as his opinion that "Thar was some mighty
big sinners on the head of the Calapooia." Dr. J. N.
Perkins preached for the Christians, and Rev. H. H.
Spalding for the Presbyterians.</p>

<p>P. V. Crawford, for whom Crawfordsville is named,
was the first regularly appointed postmaster on the Calapooia.
Previous to his appointment in 1870 there had
been a supplied post office at William Heisler's store,
where Crawfordsville now is. There was never any great
number of manufacturing enterprises in the Calapooia
country. A flouring mill, a sawmill or two, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
woolen mill at Brownsville, built about 1862, constitute
the sum of such enterprises. The chief production is
still from the farm&mdash;live stock and farm produce. The
range is now greatly curtailed through growth of brush,
close pasturage, and taking up of land.</p>

<p>There were in this region several men who were public
spirited and prominent in Oregon affairs in early times.
Foremost of all was Delazon Smith, who lived down
toward Albany, on the Albany prairie, but was well
known and claimed by all the Linn County section.
Smith was a preacher when he first lived in Oregon. On
one occasion he was heard to say, when preaching at
Brownsville, that he had been urged to give up preaching
and go into law, but that he would not give up what religion
he had for all the wealth of the world. Strange to
say, however, that was really the last sermon he ever
preached. Soon after he is said to have been offered
a fee of $1,000 to defend a man in a criminal case, and
from that time on he followed law and politics. He was a
member of the constitutional convention, was in the
legislature, and stumped the state with Col. E. D. Baker
in the race for United States senator. Hugh Brown,
founder of Brownsville, was also prominent in politics
and was a member of the constitutional convention. J. N.
Rice and Robert Glass were in the legislature in early
times, and R. C. Finley, though not so prominent politically,
was a wealthy, liberal, public spirited man, who
wielded considerable influence.</p>

<p>No serious Indian troubles ever came upon the settlers
on the Calapooia. T. A. Riggs tells how the Indians
used to steal from the whites, and describes a little difficulty
he and a neighbor had with them over the stealing
of an ox, but the Indians of this section never attempted
to make war on the whites. At a later time, 1856, there
was a fear that the Indians on the other side of the Cascades,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
who were then on the warpath, might come over
and fall upon the settlers along the Calapooia. At Fern
Ridge a fort was built in anticipation of such a contingency,
but results proved their fears groundless, and that
they had perhaps given the eastern Indians credit for
more energy than they possessed.</p>

<p>During war times there was considerable feeling in this
region. The people were many of them from Missouri,
and many were Douglas democrats. When the war commenced
a considerable number of Douglas democrats
turned Republicans. A party composed of Union men
and Douglas democrats put out a county ticket in 1862
in Linn County. It was called the Cayuse ticket. Both
Union and non-Union men formed secret societies. The
democrats organized a secret society known as the
Knights of the Golden Circle, one of its objects being to
prevent a draft. George Helm was the leading democrat
at this time in this section, and was called the "Lion of
Linn." The Union men formed the Union League, the
chief object of which was to watch the democrats. It
was thought at one time that the Knights of the Golden
Circle would attempt to capture the fort at Vancouver,
but no such attempt was ever made.</p>

<p>As I have before stated, the course of settlement and
development in the Calapooia country was quiet and
uneventful. The settlers were at first all poor, all subject
to the hardships incident to living in a new country,
shut off from many conveniences of an older community,
and obliged to ascertain by experiment what crops
paid best and how they were best handled. Currency
was scarce in the settlement and wheat served to a large
extent as a medium of exchange. When the men who
had been drawn to the gold mines to seek their fortunes
began to return with their gold dust there was a rapid
advance in business and prosperity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>The first newspaper of this locality was printed by
George Dyson; the name and date I can not now give.
The second was the <i>Informant</i>, printed, like the first, at
Brownsville, and by a man named Stein. This was in
1886. In 1887 the <i>Express-Advance</i> was started with the
<i>Informant's</i> plant and continued two years. The <i>Brownsville
Times</i> was started June 15, 1889, by McDonald &amp;
Cavendish. With several changes of editors this paper
is still printed, the present proprietors being F. M. Brown
and A. B. Cavender.</p>

<p>The question as to why the first settlers came to Oregon
is difficult to determine. It seems, however, from the
very limited amount of direct testimony I have been able
to get, that there were two forces which at least had a
powerful influence, and these were, first, curiosity to see
this great western country; and, secondly, the desire to
pick out a good piece of land from the thousands of acres
open to settlement here.</p>

<hr class="l15" />
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">Albany</span>, Oregon, September 21, 1901.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Geo. O. Goodall, Eugene, Oregon</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: In compliance with your request I will write a short
account of the early settlement of the upper Calapooia Valley and some
of the annoyances with which the first settlers had to contend, and as
I have to depend entirely on memory, I am aware that my account will
be very imperfect and the more so as I am almost alone as one of the
first settlers, and I believe the only one above Brownsville.</p>

<p>I crossed the plains in 1846, stopping near Oregon City till the next
fall, when I settled in Brush Creek Valley, Brush Creek being the
south fork of the Calapooia. When I came here I found Alexander
Kirk, W. R. Kirk, James Blakely, Hugh L. Brown, and Jonathan
Keeney, all living in the vicinity of where Brownsville now is, they
all having crossed the plains in 1846 and come on up the valley to the
Calapooia. I also found R. C. Finley some six miles farther up the
stream, who also crossed the plains the same year, but settled on the
Calapooia in the spring of 1847. Mrs. Agnes B. Courtnay, who came
to Oregon in 1845, and whose husband had been killed near Oregon
City by a falling tree, made up the settlers on the Calapooia at that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
time. I will state here that Mr. Finley had settled at the falls of the
Calapooia where he contemplated building, and did in 1848 build a
flouring mill, being the first mill south of Salem. In the fall of 1847,
as before stated, I and Asa Moore settled in Brush Creek Valley above
Mr. Finley, he being the upper settler up to that time, and at the same
time James McHargue and Robert Montgomery, who crossed the
plains that season, settled below Mr. Finley and Thomas Fields several
miles farther up the stream. Wm. T. Templeton, William Robnett,
William McCaw, John Findlay, John A. Dunlap, and Thomas S.
Woodfin all crossed the plains in 1847 and subsequently settled on the
Calapooia, but after the annoyance with the Indians had ceased.</p>

<p>The Indians in these early days were in the habit of stealing horses
and cattle from the settlers and butchering them, and the settlers
would trail them up and if able to catch them would flog them severely,
but the Indians seemed to care about as much as a cur for such treatment
and would laugh about it as if it was all a huge joke. Some time
during the summer of 1847 Isaac B. Courtnay was hunting in Brush
Creek Valley, being above the settlement at that time, when he met
with a few Indians, who took his gun and ammunition and allowed him
to go home. During the fall and winter of 1847 the Indians annoyed
Mr. Fields so much that he finally moved down to my place on Brush
Creek and stayed until the spring of 1848.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1847 when I and Mr. Moore came into Brush Creek
Valley we were not aware that there were any Indians near there and
selected a place to build a cabin in which to spend the winter, we being
single men, were going to batch through the winter, when I intended
to bring my mother to live with me, my father having died soon after
starting for Oregon. When we commenced cutting logs for our cabin
two or three Indians appeared on the scene and inquired what we were
doing there, and on being told we were going to settle there they
demanded pay for the land, and we finally made a bargain with them
agreeing to pay them in wheat and pease after the next harvest, this
being the way in which many of the early settlers bargained with them.</p>

<p>During the fall and early winter when an Indian happened to be
present at mealtime we gave him something to eat, but it soon became
apparent that if we kept this up we would run out of provisions before
spring, as there were one or more Indians there nearly every meal, so
we were obliged to quit feeding them, when they demanded pay for
their land again we told them, however, that we would pay them
according to contract. Soon after this they moved away, and we saw
no more of them on Brush Creek.</p>

<p>As Mr. Finley was contemplating the building of a mill the next
summer he traded for a fat ox which I had brought with me, intending
to butcher him when he commenced work, but soon after the Indians
left the ox disappeared also. When we missed him from the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
cattle Mr. Finley and I took a circuit around the range of the cattle
and struck his trail going toward the Santiam, and after tracking him
a mile or two we came across the same Indians, where they were
camped and were drying the beef, having killed the ox. When we
turned toward the camp Mr. Finley said if that Indian runs I'll shoot
him. When they saw us coming they broke for the brush and Mr.
Finley fired at one of them, they in their hurry leaving everything in
camp, including the only gun they had.</p>

<p>After selecting such things as we could carry that would be of any
value we made a bonfire of the rest, burning everything they had.
When we started away I saw an Indian head come up by the side of a
log in the timber and took a shot at him, it was a long shot, and I think
the ball struck the log, but the head disappeared very suddenly. Another
Indian started to run from behind a tree when Mr. Finley fired,
aiming, as he said, to break a leg, wounding the Indian above the knee,
but not disabling him. This caused quite an excitement in the settlement,
the Indians and many of the settlers fearing it would cause an
outbreak among the Indians, arguing that we ought not have shot at
them, but should have treated them as others had done. However,
Mr. Finley and I told them that if they didn't want to be shot at they
must not steal from us, as we would shoot every time and that to kill.
This put a stop to their stealing in this part of the country and we were
not annoyed after that by the natives, and they never called for the pay
for their land.</p>

<p>The Rev. H. H. Spalding taught a neighborhood school in a log
schoolhouse one mile above where Brownsville now stands in the
summer of 1849, there being no public schools in the country at that
time. The first school district on the Calapooia, being the third in
Linn County, was organized, I think, in the spring of 1853; but many
of the early records of the county were burned in the courthouse, and
I am unable to give the precise date. The first school was taught in
the district in the summer of 1853 by Robert Moore.</p>

<p>As to the motive for coming to the Willamette Valley at that early
date I hardly know how to answer, unless it was love of adventure, as
the question of sovereignty had not been settled between the United
States and England when I came here. True, the United States senate
had been discussing the matter of giving each settler in Oregon six
hundred and forty acres of land, and we rather expected that would be
done, but we had no real assurance that such would be the case.</p>

<p>Among the early county officers of Linn County, after its organization
under the Territorial Government, quite a number were living on
the Calapooia, Alexander Kirk being elected county judge, N. D. Jack
assessor, John A. Dunlap representative, and William McCaw clerk in
1849, and in 1850 several men who were elected to county officers went
to the mines and failed to qualify, among them the county treasurer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
and at a special election I was elected to that office and received and
disbursed the first taxes ever collected in Linn County.</p>

<p>In 1851 I was elected assessor and was the second man to assess the
county. In 1856 I served as second lieutenant in the Rogue-river war.
In 1862 was elected sheriff for two years.</p>

<p>Yours truly,</p>

<p class="center">ARRIVAL OF EMIGRATION COMPANY NO. I.</p>

<p>On the first page of to-day's paper will be found a notice of the return
of Lieutenant Fremont's exploring company. By this company
we are put into possession of several interesting letters from different
members of the emigrating company, and, among others, three from
our former townsman, M. M. McCarver, one of which, directed to our
delegate, together with a letter written by P. H. Burnett to the <i>Saint
Louis Reporter</i>, we publish below.&mdash;<i>Iowa Gazette</i> [Burlington].</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Twalatine Plains</span>, Oregon Territory, November 6, 1843.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: I avail myself of an opportunity offered by one of the
vessels belonging to the Hudson Bay Company to forward you a few
lines.</p>

<p>The emigrants have not all arrived, though more than half are here,
and the remainder may be looked for in a few days, all were at the
Methodist Mission, about one hundred and fifty miles distant, near
The Dalles. On last week several of the families arrived within a few
days of Fort Vancouver and the Wallammatte Falls&mdash;some by water
and others over the Cascade Mountains. The waggons will be brought
from The Dalles by water, as the season is now too far advanced to
open a road through the mountains. This expedition establishes the
practicability beyond doubt of a waggon road across the continent by
the way of the southern pass in the Rocky Mountains. We have had
no difficulty with the natives, although we have had a tedious journey.
We have had less obstacles in reaching here than we had a right to
expect, as it was generally understood before leaving the States that
one third of the distance, to wit, from Fort Hall to this place, was
impassable with waggons. Great credit, however, is due to the energy,
perseverance, and industry of this emigrating company, and particularly
to Doctor Whitman, one of the missionaries at the Walla Walla
Mission, who accompanied us out. His knowledge of the route was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
considerable, and his exertions for the interest of the company were
untiring. Our journey may now be said to be at an end, and we are
now in the Wallammatte Valley. I have been here near three weeks,
having left my waggon in charge of the teamster and proceeded on
horseback from Fort Hall in company with some thirty persons, principally
young men. Your first question now will be, "how are you
satisfied with the country? Is it worthy of the notice that Congress
has given it?" I would answer these in the affirmative. Perhaps there
is no country in the world of its size that offers more inducements to
enterprise and industry than Oregon. The soil in this valley and in
many other portions of the territory is equal to that of Iowa, or any
other portion of the United States, in point of beauty and fertility,
and its productions in many articles are far superior, particularly in
regard to wheat, potatoes, beets, and turnips. The grain of the wheat
is more than one third larger than any I have seen in the States. Potatoes
are abundant and much better than those in the States. I
measured a beet which grew in Doctor Whitman's garden which
measured in circumference two inches short of three feet, and there is
now growing in the field of Mr. James Johns, less than a mile from
this place where I write you, a turnip measuring in circumference four
and one half feet, and he thinks it will exceed five feet before pulling
time. Indeed, everything here is in a flourishing condition&mdash;trade
brisk and everybody doing well. The emigrants generally are all, as
far as I know, satisfied. Wages for a common hand is from $1 to $1.50
per day, and mechanics from $2 to $4. Wheat is quite abundant and
sold to ship or emigrants at $1 per bushel. Flour is from $9 to $10 per
barrel; potatoes and turnips fifty cents per bushel; beef from six to
eight cents per pound; American cows from $60 to $70; California,
from $15 to $20. The prairie is coated with a rich green grass, perhaps
the most nutritious in the world; and I am told that the winter
is never so severe or the grass so scarce that a poor horse will not fatten
in the space of one month. Nothing is wanted but industry to
make this one of the richest little countries in the world. I say little,
because the fertile part of it is small compared with the very extensive
fertile countries in the valley of the Mississippi; yet we have a
country sufficient in extent and resources to maintain in lucrative occupations
millions of inhabitants. Its great hydraulic power immediately
on the seashore, the advantages for stock grazing or wool growing,
its fertile soil and indeed, its very isolated situation from competition
with the rest of the civilized world, all combine with other circumstances
to make it one of the most desirable countries under the sun
for industry and enterprise.</p>

<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

<span class="i6">February 19, 1846.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>: It was with pleasure I received yours of March
8, 1845; also one from Cyrel at the same time (Nov. last, 1845), and
was happy to hear of general health, and that I am blest with the
same, and have been ever since I have been in this territory; and, in
fact, I have not had an hour's sickness for five years past. You ask
me to give a sketch of my travels since I first arrived in Missouri. It
is not possible for me to do so, with any degree of accuracy at present.
Although I have a Journal of much of my trampings, it is now 200
miles distant, and I will not be able to get it before our mail starts for
the U. S. I have also a daily journal of our journey to this country,
and one of the weather for the first year I was here, which I sent you
by the return party of 1845, but we have ascertained, that our letters
were all lost, so I am aware you did not receive mine of '45, but hope
it may not keep you from writing in the spring.</p>

<p>The Ship by which I intended to send you letters, was sold at the
Sandwich Islands, and consequently did not return to the U. S. Now
of my tramp: I will mearly say that I have ranged over nearly the
whole country west of the Missouri River and east of the Rocky Mountains,
from the British line on the north to the center of New Mexico
on the south. The country is nearly of a sameness, quite a barren,
sandy desert, with the exception of borders of streams, valleys, mountains,
&amp;c. The whole country abounds in game and Indians&mdash;the latter
generally hostile. I could tell you of some long hunting yarns, and
Indian fights, but they are of too little interest to spend time with
now; so I will wait until I take a walk down East, and then some long
evening, over a mug of cider and dish of apples, you shall have them.</p>

<p>I was some of the time in employ of Fur &amp; Trading Co., and some
of my time a free trapper. A hunter's life is a dog's life, exposed to
all kinds of danger and hardships, and but little gained at last, but
men soon get so accustomed to it that in a short time they fear neither
man, musket, or the D&mdash;&mdash;, and there is so much nature, romance, and
excitement in their way of living, that they soon become much attached
to it, for it is much easier for a white man to become an Indian, than to
reverse the thing. I have been compelled to [by] hunger to eat mules,
horses, dogs, wolves, badgers, ground hogs, skunks, frogs, crickets,
ants, and have been without food of any kind for six days and nights.
Cats, dogs, or anything else, is right good eating meat at such times.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>At another time we were four days, and three out of the four compelled
to fight our way as we traveled, but hungry men are fond of
fight and fear nothing, and so we walked through. You may think
crickets and ants rather small game to shoot at, and so it is, but we
have another way of taking them, which is by going in search, early
in the morning, when the crickets (which are in some parts very numerous
and as large as the end of your thumb,) by the coolness of the
air and dew are very stupid, and climb to the top of weeds in great
numbers that the sun may get a fair chance at them; they are at such
times easily captured by jarring them off into a basket and then roasting
them with hot stones,&mdash;feathers, guts, and all,&mdash;and make very
good eating&mdash;when one gets used to it. The ants are taken by sticking
a stick in the center of their hill, and making a fire around it,
which compels them to ascend the stick, and from that to the basket
or sack; in this way a meal is soon procured. But those times are all
past with me.</p>

<p>I am now where we have plenty to eat and out of many dangers
to which a man is exposed, and I know well how to prize it. As to how
I got here I think I gave you some idea in my letter of 1844, and as I
am not able to give the particulars, I will say nothing about it, but I
will assure you I am here on Clatsop Plains, at the mouth of the Columbia
River, within three quarters of a mile of the Pacific Ocean, in
a country that when I arrived here was so thinly populated that I was
able to become acquainted with every white person in the territory;
but the two last years has so increased the population that two fifths
are now strangers to me; 1844 gave by land an emigration of about
1,200; 1845 nearly twice that number; this year we expect them by
the thousands. The people who come here are from all parts of the
globe, but mostly from the western states of the U. S. A great portion
are single men, roving characters, who are from every place but this,
and this they can not well leave; and the prospects of our infant country
are so flattering that we have no inclination to leave it; at present
almost every man that arrives here, is at once filled with enterprise,
and dives heels over head into something.</p>

<p>We have now a population of five or six thousand; there is now in
operation six sawmills and five flouring mills, six stores, exclusive of
the Hudson Bay Co., six blacksmith shops, and three gunsmiths, carpenter
shops in any number, two tan yards, Lawyers, Doctors, and
Preachers by the dozen. We have a legislature, and they have made
scores of laws, the particulars of which you will get in the <i>Oregon
Spectator</i>, a paper which is printed at Wellemette Falls, once in two
weeks; the first number came out last week. I sent you one or two
numbers of the first print of the <i>Northwest Coast</i>. I presume you would
like to know something of the situation of our country, the climate,
production, natural resources, &amp;c., of which I will attempt to give you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
a slight idea. The general character of the country is broken and
mountainous, but is interspersed with beautiful valleys. The first I
shall introduce to you is the place of Clatsop; it is very small, but
beautiful; it is bounded on the north by the Columbia, west by the
ocean, and south and east by heavy timbered land; it is about twenty
miles in length by two in breadth; from the sea beach to the big timber
the soil is of the best quality, capable of producing any vegetation
grown in any of the northern or western states in the U. S. As the
wind is nine tenths of the time from the salt water, I believe it to be
one of the most healthy places on the globe. It is now four years since
the first whites settled here, and there has not been a case of sickness
nor a death as yet, and but ten or fifteen births, for there is not a
woman that has a husband, but what well fulfills the Commandment
by about every year giving birth to a fine chub, and very often two at
a time, and some instances of women, without husbands, lending a
hand in populating our valuable country, and all owing to the climate
and shellfish (?) which we have in abundance.</p>

<p>The number of families at this place is fourteen, counting in five
bachelor halls. The tide flows from 9 to 12 feet perpendicular at the
mouth of the Columbia. We will now proceed up the river. Thirteen
miles from the bar is old Astoria, now occupied by the H. B. Co. This
place is a beautiful situation for a town, and will probably be the New
York of Oregon; it has a full view of the whole harbor, and a vessel
can lay at any time in perfect safety. Now three miles and we come
to Tongue Point; this is a narrow point of land running into the river;
a fortification on it could have full command of the river, as the
channel runs near the point. On we go; heavy timber and broken
land on each side of the river, which is from three to ten miles wide;
we now come to the mill which I told you I was erecting. I will tell you
more of that by and by, but we will go ahead. The banks of the river
heavy timbered and broken, but the soil rich; we now come to Coulitye
[Cowlitz] River, which is about 200 yards wide at the mouth, comes in
on the north side of the Columbia, about 50 miles from the mouth of
the Columbia. We will ascend this river 15 miles, against a strong
current. The country now opens out into a large plain, many miles in
length and breadth, the soil of the best quality, beautifully watered,
and interspersed with timber. At the time I first visited these parts
there were but fourteen families of French and half-breeds, but since
that time there has been a number of American families settled in
this section. The valley is one or more hundred miles, in diameter,
and situated on one of the noblest harbors on our coast, that, is the
Puget Sound. Now we will return to the Columbia, and ascend 40
miles to the Willemette River, of which you will get an idea by the
paper which I send. Six miles above the Willemette River is Vancouvers,
the principal depot of the Hudson Bay Co.; all of their shipping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
ascends to this place, though not without some difficulty, particularly
if the craft draws more than thirteen feet of water.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Fort Vancouver there is much fine farming land.
The company has fine farms, and many thousand head of cattle. Fifty
or sixty miles above are the Cascades; it is where the river crosses the
Cascade Mountains, a range running north and south. East of these
mountains is a country extending many hundred miles in each direction,
and most particularly adapted to grazing. Stock of all kinds can
live here winter and summer without the least care. This is as far as
I have seen the country, though it is said there is much fine country in
the south of the territory, but no settlements in that section.</p>

<p>Our stock keeps fat through the winter without care; we had no
snow last winter nor this. Buds are now swelling, and some flowers in
bloom. You wished to know where we get saws to saw our big timber.
I brought two, of the longest kind, with me, and we have since had
two from the Hudson Bay Co., and three from the States. We have
timber of all sizes, so we take our choice; we have some 16 feet in
diameter and 300 feet in length; no mistake. I have measured such.
We have shipped three cargoes of lumber to the Sandwich Islands, for
which we received $20 per thousand feet, clear of freight. Lumber is,
and will be, a great source of wealth to this country. The Columbia,
and its tributaries, are alive with salmon during the summer months;
the Indians take them in great numbers with spears, nets, and seines;
there are many packed and sent to foreign markets annually.</p>

<p>I am now improving me a farm on Clatsop Plains. I have a splendid
claim of six hundred and forty acres of land, about fifty acres timber,
the rest prairie&mdash;laying immediately on the Pacific. We are all very
anxious to hear the result of the treaty (if one is made) between the
<i>U. S.</i> and John Bull. We are very much afraid Uncle will fool away
the north of the Columbia; if he does we shall be <i>Silux</i>. We are very
anxious the U. S. should extend her jurisdiction over our valuable
country, and we are nearly out of patience with the delay. We are
not all thieves and runaways, as represented by the Hon Mr. Mc&mdash;&mdash;,
nor our country a booty. Boy, if it is, it's inferior to none in point
of beauty, pleasant climate, natural resources, and advantages of
wealth; and if the settlers were ever thieves they have wholly reformed,
for it is generally believed that no other colony has ever
equaled this in point of bravery, enterprise, hospitality, honesty, and
morality. There are men who arrived here in October last who have
at this time one hundred acres fenced and sown to wheat. Now, all we
want is a little of Uncle Sam's care, that capitalists may be safe in investing
their money.</p>

<p>Merchandise is generally high here, owing to the scarcity and great
demand. Salt $1 per bush.; sugar 12½ cts. per lb.; coffee 25 cts. per lb.;
molasses 50 cts. per gal.: tea 50 cts. to $1.50; nails 18 cts.: window
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
glass 10 to 12 cts. per light; dry goods in proportion; beef, pork, hides,
tallow, and most kinds of produce taken in payment; beef $6 per h.;
pork $10; hides $2 apiece by the lot; tallow 8 to 10; butter 20 to 25;
wheat 75 cts. to $1; oats 75 cts.; potatoes 50 cts. per bu.; lumber from
15 to $25 per 1,000 feet; shingles 4 to $5 per 1,000; common laborers $1
per day, and mechanics $2. You see by the manner of my writing that
I am in great haste, therefore you must allow me to close.</p>

<p>After you peruse this I want you to enclose it, and, with love and respect,
send it to Cyrel, for I have not a moment's time to write to him,
and I have nothing to say to him only to be sure he is right and then
go ahead; and for you both, to send me letters every chance, for I
value each letter at five hundred dollars&mdash;provided I could get them
no cheaper. Give my love to father, sister, and all inquiring friends,
and should like to see some of you in Oregon.</p>

<p>The above letter was written by Tallmadge B. Wood,

<p>Copy of a letter written from Oregon City, formerly
Willemette Falls, Oregon, December 23, 1847, by Tallmadge

sister.&mdash;<i>Florence E. Baker.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">Oregon City</span>, December 23, '47.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>: I avail myself of this opportunity of writing you
a few lines that you may know that I am still in the land of the living.
I received one letter from you by the arrival of Mr. Shively, being the
second one that I have received from you since I have been in this
brush. We, of course, got news of the fate of the "Oregon Bill" of
last session, and as you may judge was very much disappointed, but
we grin and bear it because there is no other way for us to do. We
are at present in rather an awkward situation; there has of late been
some serious difficulties with the upper country Indians in which Dr.
Whitman, wife and nine others were murdered.</p>

<p>There were fifty men dispatched last week to protect the Mission at
the Dals, [Dalles]; we have had no news from them since. There are
orders for the raising of five hundred men to go up and give the scoundrels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
a wiping out. So you may say we have the loud cry of war in Oregon;
but what is done here, is done by the voluntary acts of the people
and without pay. And as there is such a diversity of opinions, as to
the best way to proceed, I think there will not be as much done at
present, as we have got so many people here that it is not so easy for
them all to agree as it was in former times.</p>

<p>This year's emigration was very large. They all got through with
less difficulties than that of last year. There has been considerable
sickness with them. Their disease being the measles, the disorder is
proving quite fatal with the natives; it was in consequence of this that
Dr. Whitman was killed, as they held a malice against the whites for
bringing the disorder unto the country.</p>

<p>Our legislature being in session, it has authorized Mr. Meek to go
to the United States with dispatches to the government, informing it
of our situation. He starts to-morrow morning, and it is by him that
I send this letter. It is a general time of good health and spirits, in
Oregon, with the exception of now and then a case of the measles.
Our commerce has much improved within the last year. A large
number of ships have left our port the last season well ladened.</p>

<p>The winter thus far is very fine, no freezing, and little rain. Wheat
looks well, and great quantity sown. I have sold my interest in my
mill, and also my farm. I am going to put up salmon next spring, and
after the season is over, which will be in August, I am going to build a
mill, as I now have one of the best sites on the Columbia, and lumbering
the best business in Oregon.</p>

<p>I would write much more, had I time and room on my sheet&mdash;though
I am sure it would not be very interesting. Be sure and send me a
letter every time the Ship Whiton sailed for the U. S. as it will return
to this country. Be sure and avail that chance though I missed it.
Give Father my Respects; tell him I intend on coming to see him once
more. I must scratch a few lines to sisters, so I bid you a Farewell.</p>

<p>Dear Sisters, I have only room to tell you that I am well. I Farmed
it and did housework last summer, but I guess I don't do it again soon.
There are lots of pretty girls here now, but I do not get time to get
one of them just now, but will take a year or two, by and by, and
attend to these matters.</p>

<p>Frances must write to Cyrel for me, for it is now late and I haven't
time. Give my love to all cousins and inquiring friends. Write every
chance.</p>

<p>Good by, your affectionate brother,<br />
<span class="left65">T. B. WOOD.</span></p>

The above letter was folded, and sent without an envelope: It was sealed with
a red seal; it cost ten cents postage; it was mailed at St. Joseph, Mo.; it was directed
to Isaac Nash, Ballston Spa, Sarotogo County, N. Y.; it arrived at Sarotogo

sheets of pale blue paper with black ink, and is in good preservation now, 1908.&mdash;<i>Florence

<p>Mr. H. S. Lyman requests the insertion of the following
note referring to the recently published "Complete History
of Oregon":</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>To the Editor</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>As my attention has been called to some points deemed erroneous
in the History of Oregon, I would ask space in the <span class="smcap">Oregon Historical
Quarterly</span> to say to subscribers or purchasers of the work that I
would esteem it a favor that any matter deemed inaccurate or erroneous
be communicated to me.</p>

<p>Errors in a publication are usually of the following character: Typographical,
merely; slips of the proofreader; mistakes of transcription;
misapprehension of the writer; or of differences in authorities. Besides
this there is the wide field of differences in opinions, or conclusions&mdash;many
being unable to distinguish between a fact and what is
properly but their own personal inference from facts, or supposed
facts. Still further, different persons will estimate differently the
value of events, and give varying proportions to the elements constituting
the whole.</p>

<p>Typographical errors, or mere blunders of haste, should not, certainly,
be expected in a standard work; yet are almost invariably
found, particularly in the first edition; and, indeed, seldom or never
disappear entirely; almost every teacher, or student, including myself,
having noticed, or reported such even in standard text-books. By reference
to the preface of my history it will be seen that the work was
undertaken with full understanding that a complete, or critical, history
of Oregon could not yet be written; but it was thought worth while
now to lay the basis of an investigation and ask the patronage of the
public. I would, therefore, feel it a most friendly courtesy if any supposedly
erroneous matter, whether mere slips, or differences of information
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
or opinion&mdash;in the great number of details that it has been
attempted to furnish&mdash;would be reported to me. I am confident that
the work has been begun on a sufficiently broad basis to bear much
further elaboration. Any mistakes reported, together with such as
may be found by myself, will, if they seem sufficiently numerous and
formidable, be collated and published as a page of errata, and the
corrected list be furnished each subscriber or purchaser, so far as these
may be known.</p>

<p>I hope that this may prove a useful line of inquiry, and place the
readers somewhat on their own mettle, and thus furnish me matter for
notice in a second edition, if this should be produced. Such investigation
and criticism would also establish more firmly in public confidence
such data as do not prove open to question.</p>

<h3>OREGON AND ITS SHARE IN THE
CIVIL WAR.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></h3>

<p>By the Convention of 1818, renewed in 1827, the Oregon
Country, comprising a large part of what is now denominated
in general terms, the Pacific Northwest, was
under the joint occupancy of Great Britain and the United
States.</p>

<p>The practical evidence of this joint sovereignty on the
part of the British, was the sway of the Hudson Bay
Company through its network of trading stations and
outfitting points for its cohorts of frontiersmen and trappers.
Until the advent of the missionary movement from
the States, there was little practical evidence of the coordinate
sovereignity of the United States.</p>

<p>When the missionary movement took important shape
numerically it resulted in a vital need for some form of
local government, and hence there arose the Provisional
Government of Oregon, as it was called, fashioned on the
lines of state or territorial governments on the other side
of the intervening mountains and plains, "deriving its
just powers from the consent of the governed," and empowered
by that consent to maintain inviolate as far as
possible "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>In 1846, abandoning the political war cry of "Fifty-four
Forty or Fight," which had served its demagogic
use as a partisan rallying call, a boundary treaty was
finally concluded between England and the United States
fixing the forty-ninth parallel of latitude as the northern
most boundary of the Oregon Country and of the United
States in the Northwest.</p>

<p>But still the provisional Government of the immigrants,
incomplete in concept, rude in operation, imperfect in
power, was the only form of government, the ten to fifteen
thousand Americans in this vast domain had to insure
domestic tranquillity or oppose resistance to the ever
present savage foe.</p>

<p>In message after message President Polk called the attention
of Congress to its inaction and the dangers to
which that inaction exposed the settlers and how far
short of its manifest duty the national legislators were in
their neglect; but there were mighty reasons back of this
neglect; mighty forces were battling in the halls of legislation&mdash;the
titanic combat was on between Freedom and
Slavery and the Missouri Compromise line was some
leagues to the northward of where California began. The
Provisional Legislature of 1845 had taken firm ground on
the slavery question and the ordinance of 1787 prohibiting
slavery was incorporated in its organic law.</p>

<p>The Douglas house bill of 1846, seeking to organize a
territorial government for Oregon, followed in this regard
the expressed desire of the colonists, and met a prompt and
instant defeat at the hands of the Southern senators.
Thereupon, Douglas sought to get around the question
by a different bill (he was then in the Senate) containing
a clause sanctioning the colonial laws of Oregon, which
would, as a matter of fact, accomplish the same result.
Joseph L. Meek, an accredited representative of the colonists
had undergone a dangerous overland winter journey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
to enforce upon the President and Congress the necessity
of immediate action and of Federal aid in the constant
conflict with the surrounding Indian tribes.</p>

<p>Judge Thornton, the personal representative of Governor
Abernethy of the provisional government, was also
in Washington on the same errand, having come by ocean.</p>

<p>The senate bill of Douglas was finally passed, after
being amended in the spirit of compromise ever dominant
in those days, whereby the colonial laws on the subject
of slavery were to be continued in force until such time
as "the legislature could adopt some other law on the
subject," but the House promptly laid this bill on the
table and rejoined with a measure practically identical
with the Douglas house bill of 1846, and after a long and
bitter contest, in which Thomas H. Benton led the fight
for Oregon, on the fourteenth of August, 1848, Oregon
became a territory of the United States on her own terms,
and free soil in name as well as in fact.</p>

<p>President Polk promptly appointed General Joseph
Lane, of Indiana, a native of North Carolina, and a
veteran commander of the Mexican war, as the first territorial
governor of Oregon, and urged upon him the
immediate organization of the government, in order that
it might be inaugurated before March 4, 1849, when there
would be a change in the presidency.</p>

<p>The long journey of Governor Lane, accompanied by
ex-Delegate Meek, now United States Marshal, across the
continent by the Santa Fé trail, and up the coast from
San Francisco, is one of the stirring incidents of those
stirring times, and on the third of March, 1849, but one
day before the expiration of President Polk's term of
office, General Lane issued a proclamation making known
that he entered upon the discharge of the duties of his
office, and proclaiming the Federal laws in force over the
Oregon country. Thus was the consummation so longed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
for by the President brought to pass, and what he had
striven for so long and so patriotically fulfilled in the
closing hours of his administration. During the years
of territorial government the slavery question that was
tormenting the brain and conscience of the North and
the heart and chivalry of the South, played but little part
in the life of the far distant territory.</p>

<p>The political complexion of the territory was overwhelmingly
Democratic, but it was democracy of the
free soil order, which only asked of the negro to keep out
of its sight and out of its mind. In line with this temper
was the enforcement against two unfortunate blacks of
the territorial enactment against free negroes, which being
promptly held constitutional by the territorial supreme
court, the two offenders were gently but firmly deported
from the boundaries of the "white man's country." This
same deep-lying sentiment found added expression in the
forth coming State Constitution, wherein it was enacted
"No free negro or mulatto not residing in this State at the
time of the adoption of this Constitution shall come,
reside, or be within this State, or hold any real estate, or
make any contracts, or maintain any suit therein; and
the legislative assembly shall provide by penal laws for
the removal by public officers of all such negroes and
mulattoes, and for their effectual exclusion from the State,
and for the punishment of persons who shall bring them
into the State or employ or harbor them." Added expression
was given to this point of view in the vote on
the subject of admission of free negroes, submitted to
the people in connection with the vote on the adoption
of the proposed constitution&mdash;here the vote in favor of
their admission was 1,081, contrarywise 8,640.</p>

<p>A potent influence at Washington towards Oregon's
admission as a state was the well-known democracy of
the State, and at home the indebtedness to the colonists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
of the National Government in connection with the
Indian wars&mdash;it seemed plain that two senators and one
congressman who could vote as well as talk could accomplish
more than one delegate who could only talk; and
so the vote for the adoption of the State Constitution was
7,195 for and only 3,215 against.</p>

<p>On the subject of slavery, submitted to the people at
the same election, the vote was likewise significant and
illuminating, 7,727 voted for freedom and but 2,645 for
slavery. Coming as this overwhelming vote did when
the agitation of the slavery question was at a white heat
both in and out of Congress, it was startling in its clear
and unequivocal verdict on this great question&mdash;and it is
especially significant when we recall the great preponderance
of Oregon voters born in slaveholding states and
cradled in the doctrine of African bondage. Can the
conclusion be other than that they realized the economic
and moral blight of the slave system and resolved to
have none of it in their fair State.</p>

<p>In this election the free soil democrats and the whigs
under Thomas J. Dryer were found quietly but none the
less actually fighting shoulder to shoulder.</p>

<p>It is a delicate task to attempt to chronicle history
while yet the actual participants are some of them living
and the children and grandchildren of many more constitute
our friends and neighbors, and far be it from me
to criticise the motives or sincerity of those who were
wrong in the troublous days that followed except in so
far as is necessary to set forth the facts of history.</p>

<p>On the fourteenth of February, 1859, Oregon became
a State of the Union. From the loins of the old Whig
party in Oregon, as well as elsewhere in the country,
sprang forth that young giant the Republican party, and
to the leadership of Dryer was added the silvery eloquence
of Edward D. Baker, lately come from California.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
The uncompromising slavery wing of the Democratic
party nominated John C. Breckinridge for President and
Joseph Lane, Oregon's first territorial governor and
present senator, for Vice President. Stephen A. Douglas
headed the regular Democratic ticket and Abraham
Lincoln was the Republican chieftain.</p>

<p>In Oregon there was a new alignment alike of leaders
and of the rank and file&mdash;despite the wonderful personal
popularity of Oregon's favorite son Joseph Lane, and the
passionate oratory of Delazon Smith his chief campaigner,
Oregon cast her vote for Abraham Lincoln for President
of the United States. The combined Douglas and Lincoln
vote was 9,480, while Breckinridge and Lane polled
5,074; and from this computation we see that a trifle
more than one third of the voters of Oregon were apparently
prepared to follow the programme of disunion and
secession. Colonel Baker, by a coalition of republicans
and Douglas democrats, was chosen United States Senator,
and left almost immediately for Washington to take
up his official duties; but he left behind him the courageous
inspiration of his lofty patriotism&mdash;he had played
upon and touched both the heart and conscience of the
young Commonwealth, and while the months that followed
were months of waiting and watching and of
prayer, as elsewhere in the Union, there was never any
real question, after the wonderful rousing of the public
mind and the public heart of Oregon, largely wrought
by his matchless eloquence and high ideals, that should
war, that saddest of all conflicts, a civil war, ensue, the
brave young State would stand by the flag of the Fathers
and the cause of human liberty. At the city of San Francisco,
<i>en route</i> for Washington, Colonel Baker, in fiery and
impassioned rhetoric, nailed his banner and Oregon's to
the Nation's masthead.</p>

<p>He said "As for me, I dare not, will not, be false to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
freedom. Where the feet of my youth were planted,
there by freedom my feet shall ever stand. I will walk
beneath her banner. I will glory in her strength. I
have seen her in history struck down on a hundred fields
of battle. I have seen her friends fly from her, her foes
gather around her. I have seen her bound to a stake.
I have seen them give her ashes to the winds; but when
they turned to exult, I have seen her again meet them
face to face, resplendent in complete steel, brandishing
in her strong right hand a flaming sword, red with
insufferable light. I take courage. The people gather
round her. The genius of America will yet lead her sons
to freedom."</p>

<p>How could such a spirit, such a faith fail to overcome
the forces of disunion and slavery or fail to inspire his
fellow-Oregonians with his own unalterable patriotism.
Despite all the warnings, despite all the months and years
of anticipation and alarm, here, as elsewhere, the fall of
Sumpter came like an electric shock.</p>

<p>Douglas democrats and republicans alike became but
Union men and the old flag waving in the breeze brought
tears, tears of shame and tears of determination, even to
the eyes of many who had voted for Breckinridge and
Lane.</p>

<p>On the same steamer that brought the news of the fall
of Sumpter, came Joseph Lane, the ex-senator, the defeated
candidate for Vice President. It is known that
he came prepared, if not officially, yet fully authorized
to head a movement for capturing Oregon for disunion.
Numerous boxes of guns and ammunition accompanied
him to his destination for this purpose.</p>

<p>But scarcely had he put foot on the wharves of the Oregon
metropolis, than he realized the vast misconception
he had made of his home people. Douglas democrats
and republicans, and many who had but lately voted for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
him for the vice presidency, declared without hesitation
for the Union; and the idol of the Oregon democracy,
tainted with secession and disunion, spurned even by his
former friends, made his way unaccompanied and unheralded
to his southern Oregon home by a devious trail,
fearing the mob justice of the justly enraged citizens of
the leading valley towns. And yet it was not all one way
in Oregon in those troublous days. In certain quarters
the disunion sentiment was powerful and dangerous.</p>

<p>In the Historical Society's rooms in Portland hangs a
banner first flung to the breeze on July 4, 1861, not forty
miles from that city. It is fashioned of long strips of red
and white ribbon, and in the center of its starry field is
an eagle, made by the deft fingers of a pioneer woman.
The old immigrant who donated it to the Historical Society
has related how, when he heard the news of the
fall of Sumpter, he immediately determined to celebrate
the Fourth of July by flinging the Stars and Stripes to
the breeze from his own home and with that end in view
had procured the ribbon and caused his liberty loving
wife to fashion it into his country's flag. This coming to
the ears of certain hot-heads among his neighbors, he was
called upon by a committee and asked if it was true that
he intended hoisting the Old Flag on the anniversary of
the nation's birth. To his affirmative reply came the
sharp retort that it would never be allowed to stay, but
would forthwith be torn down.</p>

<p>"No man will haul down that flag except over my
dead body," was the stern reply of the sturdy old pioneer.
The days ran by and the self-formed committee thought
that the old pioneer had heeded their warning, when one
day the news spread that a flagstaff, tall and straight, and
as unbending as the old man's determination, lay before
the pioneer house. Then the elders of the hot-heads began
to counsel moderation, to tell of the old neighbor's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
good deeds, of his unswerving sense of duty, of his faultless
marksmanship that before that flag could be lowered
not only the rough old patriot must lie cold in death but
many of the attacking party would bite the dust.</p>

<p>Reflection cooled the disunion ardor; perhaps "a tinge
of sadness, a blush of shame o'er the face of the leader
came," howbeit on the Fourth of July, 1861, that beautiful
silken banner floated on the wings of the whispering
wind and in the eagle's beak a dead serpent hung,
sounding a note of derision as well as of triumph from
the old man's heart.</p>

<p>And while in a few days a more generous impulse came
over him, and he himself took down the flag and had the
serpent removed from the eagle's beak, yet with that
single exception, until the final pæan of victory was sung
at Appomattox, that silken emblem of his beloved country
caressed by summer zephyrs and kissed by the soft
mists of winter, floated undisturbed above his patriotic
home.</p>

<p>Col. George Hunter, in his quaintly interesting narrative
"Reminiscences of an Old Timer," tells of a somewhat
similar incident down in the Rogue River country.
He says: "One day there had assembled at a store, where
the double-distilled extract of corn was chiefly dispensed,
a considerable crowd of men, most of whom were violent
secessionists, and they were soon filled up, as good democrats
were supposed to be, with the exhilarating beverage.
From some cause or other the grand old Stars
and Stripes had on this day been raised on a pole or staff
near by, and pretty soon these half-tipsy fellows took
offense at the defiant colors, and swore they would tear
it down. Two or more of them started to execute the
threat. Some of the crowd remonstrated, but to no avail.
I being a stranger and a democrat, supposed the republicans
present would protect the flag, but seeing no movement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
in that direction, and that if the flag was kept
floating something must be done and done quickly, I
grabbed an old musket that chanced to be standing in the
corner of the store, and with my best speed I made for
that flagstaff. My great-grandfathers had both served
with Washington at Brandywine and Valley Forge, and
my grandfather with Jackson at New Orleans, and I
could't stand by and see the grand old banner disgracefully
lowered by a drunken rabble of rebel sympathizers.
As I ran swiftly forward I called frequently to their leader
to stop, but he paid no attention to me. Knowing that
nearly all men carried pistols in those days, and that
these men were made desperate by drink, I determined
to have the first shot. I took a quick aim and drew the
trigger. The cap burst clear, but no report followed.
Then there was a race between me and their leader for
the flagstaff (all the rest stopped when the cap burst).
We met at the flagstaff, and just as he was about to cut
the halyards to lower the flag, my gun went off in a different
way (it didn't snap that time), and the barrel
brought down on his head proved more effective than the
bullet which refused to leave the barrel.</p>

<p>"Well, he laid down sudden like, and as I now had time
to draw my revolver, I informed the mob that I would
shoot the first man that attempted to haul down that flag
before sundown. That settled it. Friends removed my
man to the store, and many Union men gathered to my
assistance, which had the effect of stopping any further
demonstrations in that direction. At the going down of
the sun, we lowered the flag, cheering as we did so, and
laid it away with the honor we considered to be due the
'flag of the brave and the emblem of the free.'"</p>

<p>In 1861 there were only about seven hundred men and
nineteen commissioned officers in the regular army in
the whole of Oregon and Washington, the force having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
been reduced to its lowest possible limit by withdrawals
to strengthen the forces in the East. These troops were
distributed as follows: 111 men, under Capt. H. M.
Black, at Vancouver; 116 men, under Major Lugenbeel,
at Colville; 127 men, under Major Steen, at Walla Walla;
41 men, under Captain Van Voast, at the Cascades; 43
men, under Capt. F. T. Dent, at Hoskins; 110 men at
the two posts of Steilacoom and Camp Pickett, and 54
men under Lieutenant-Colonel Buchanan, at The Dalles,
all under the general command of Colonel Wright, with
Brig.-Gen. E. V. Sumner commanding the military department
of the Pacific.</p>

<p>Twofold dangers threatened the widely scattered settlements;
from without, the ever hostile Indians who
were further emboldened by the inevitable spirit of uncertainty
and unrest that followed on the heels of civil
war, and from within, disunion intrigue might at any
time blaze into armed rebellion. It was a time that
tried men's souls.</p>

<p>In June, 1861, Colonel Wright made a requisition upon
Governor Whiteaker for a three-year cavalry company to
be mustered into the service of the United States and
A. P. Dennison, former Indian Agent at The Dalles, was
appointed enrolling officer. Suspicion of the loyalty of
both the Governor and of Dennison to the Union cause,
retarded enlistment and finally led to the abandonment
of the undertaking.</p>

<p>In November, 1861, the War Department made Thomas
R. Cornelius colonel, and directed him to raise ten companies
of cavalry for the service of the United States for
three years, to be a part, as it was supposed, of the five
hundred thousand volunteers called for by President
Lincoln. Colonel Baker from Washington had taken an
active interest in encouraging the raising of this famous
regiment&mdash;it was the original regiment of Rough Riders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
of the West. There was an impression that nowhere in
the East could there be gathered together cavalrymen to
withstand the onslaughts of the dashing Southron on his
black charger and the First Oregon Cavalry was recruited
on the express promise that should the war continue they
would be speedily transferred to the Army of the Potomac
and given opportunity to cross swords with the
flower of Southern chivalry.</p>

<p>From the lava beds of Jackson County to the plains of
the Tualatin rang the bugle call to duty and the pick of
the youth of this young State were soon in the saddle
under the guidon of freedom. R. F. Maury was commissioned
lieutenant-colonel, Benjamin F. Harding,
quartermaster, C. S. Drew major, and J. S. Rinearson
junior major. Each volunteer furnished his own horse
and received for himself and mount $31 a month, $100
bounty and a land warrant for one hundred and sixty acres
of land. Company "A" was raised in Jackson County,
Capt. T. S. Harris; Company "B" in Marion County,
Capt. E. J. Harding; "C" at Vancouver, Capt. Wm.
Kelly; "D" in Jackson County by Capt. S. Truax; "E"
by Capt. George B. Currey in Wasco County; "F" by
Capt. William J. Matthews in Josephine County; and
Capt. D. P. Thompson of Oregon City and Capt. R. Cowles
of the Umpqua also had companies. Six complete companies
rendezvoused at Vancouver in May, 1862, and
were clothed in government uniforms and armed with
old-fashioned muzzle-loading rifles, pistols, and sabres.</p>

<p>Colonel Baker was the warm personal friend of Lincoln;
he had promised the boys of the First Oregon Cavalry
before recruiting began that they should have a
chance, if the war continued, of serving in the East;
many of the present survivors have told me that they
enlisted on this express promise, and had Colonel Baker
lived there is every reason to believe that with his strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
personal influence with the President, "Tom Cornelius'
Rough Riders of Oregon" would have been the prototype
in fame, as they were in fact, of "Roosevelt's Rough
Riders" of the Spanish war. Colonel Baker was the
colonel of the Fourth Illinois in the Mexican war, and it
was hardly to be expected that a man of his ardent temperament
could sit tamely in the halls of legislation while
the rattle of musketry and the roll of drums were heard
at the very gates of the national capital.</p>

<p>And thus it came to pass, for on June 28, 1861, he was
mustered into service for three years as colonel of the
First California Infantry, a regiment he recruited largely
in Pennsylvania, and which was afterwards denominated
the Seventy-first Pennsylvania. On August 6, 1861, he
was commissioned Brigadier-General of Volunteers, to
rank from May 17, which commission, although confirmed
by the Senate, he declined, as he did also a later
appointment as Major-General of Volunteers, as either
appointment would have necessitated his resignation as
senator from Oregon. It is stated that when General
Scott had to give up general command of the army on
account of his advancing years, President Lincoln tendered
the succession to Colonel Baker, which was alike
declined for the same reason.</p>

<p>With impetuous courage and passionate desire to serve
his country upon the field of battle as well as on the floor
of the Senate, Colonel Baker could not stay at the rear,
but joined his regiment at the front, and was as active in
the work of the camp as he had been upon the stump and
rostrum. Occasionally he would revisit the Senate and
participate in a day's debate and then hurry back to his
military duties. It was at such a time, sitting in his seat
in the Senate, clad in his colonel's uniform that John C.
Breckinridge of Kentucky, late pro slavery candidate for
the presidency with Joseph Lane, delivered a speech
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
which was but a reflection of the secession views of those
braver Southerners who were already in armed rebellion.
Colonel Baker grew restive under the words of Breckinridge,
his face glowed with passionate excitement, and
he sprang to the floor when the senator from Kentucky
took his seat and then and there without previous preparation
delivered that wonderful philippic, abounding in
denunciation and invective which alone would make a
niche for him in the world's temple of fame.</p>

<p>Passionately he asked "What would have been thought,
if in another capitol, in a yet more martial age, a senator
with the Roman purple flowing from his shoulders, had
risen in his place, surrounded by all the illustrations of
Roman glory, and declared that advancing Hannibal was
just and that Carthage should be dealt with in terms of
peace? What would have been thought, if after the battle
of Cannæ, a senator had denounced every levy of the
Roman people, every expenditure of its treasure, every
appeal to the old recollections and the old glories?" Mr.
Fessenden, of Maine, who sat near, responded in an undertone,
"He would have been hurled from the Tarpeian
rock;" and in tones of thunder Baker flashed forth the
suggested fate and continued "Are not the speeches of
the senator from Kentucky intended for disorganization?
Are they not intended to destroy our zeal? Are they not
intended to animate our enemies? Sir, are they not words
of brilliant polished treason even in the very capitol of
the Republic?" And then replying to a taunt of Breckinridge
about the loyalty of the Pacific coast, he went
on "When the senator from Kentucky speaks of the
Pacific I see another distinguished friend from Illinois,
now worthily representing the State of California, who
will bear witness that I know that State, too, and well.
I take the liberty, I know that I but utter his sentiments,
to say that that State will be true to the Union to the last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
of her blood and treasure. There may be some disaffected
men there and in Oregon, but the great portion of our
population are loyal to the core and in every chord of
their hearts. They are offering to add to the legions of
the country, every day, by the hundred and the thousand.
They are willing to come thousands of miles with their
arms on their shoulders, at their own expense, to share,
with the best offering of their heart's blood, in the great
struggle of constitutional liberty."</p>

<p>Can there be any different conclusion than that in that
strong passage, Colonel Baker referred among others to
the First Oregon Cavalry, which, though largely recruited
after his death, was the direct product of his inspiration
and suggestion. On the twenty-first of October, 1861,
while gallantly leading his regiment at the battle of Ball's
Bluff, Colonel Baker was instantly killed, and with his
death went the chance of the Oregon regiment to obtain
service at the seat of war.</p>

<p>As the months rolled by and no fulfillment came of the
promises that had been made for Eastern service, the
regiment joined in a round robin to President Lincoln in
which they recited the promises that had been made to
them and asked for their fulfillment. The President's
answer, filled with the lofty patriotism and spirit of unselfishness,
that was his daily part, told them that the
greatest and highest duty for all, was that which lay
nearest at hand and with the regular troops almost all
withdrawn from Oregon and Washington, and the tide of
immigrants and scattered settlements open to Indian attack
and the towns and villages liable to disunion, intrigue,
and plot, their nearest as well as their highest
duty was to guard the State from foes both savage and
traitorous from without and from open treason within.</p>

<p>And to the gallant men of the First Oregon Cavalry
the word of the great President was final. They accepted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
the task he set them to accomplish, and although
to them the pomp and circumstance of war were missing,
although no patriotic millions stood by to applaud their
gallant feats, and the eye of Government was not upon
them, yet for three long weary years they did their duty
faithfully and well, and by that faithfulness preserved
their beautiful State for the Union and the wonderful
future that has come to it.</p>

<p>Some there were of Oregon blood and Oregon soil, however,
who could not remain away from the greater theater
of war, where the more dramatic destiny of the nation was
being wrought out in havoc of blood and treasure.
Col. Joseph Hooker, "Fighting Joe Hooker," living at
Salem when the war broke out, went East, and became
a brigadier-general, and Bancroft speaks of others as
follows: "Volney Smith, son of Delazon Smith, was for
a short time lieutenant in a New York regiment; James
W. Lingenfelter, residing at Jacksonville, was made captain
of a volunteer company, and killed at Fortress
Monroe October 8, 1861; John L. Boon, son of the state
treasurer, who had been a student of the Wesleyan University,
Delaware, Ohio, was at the battles of Shiloh and
Corinth, in an Ohio regiment, in Gen. Lew Wallace's
division; Major Snooks, of the Sixty-eighth Ohio, was
formerly an Oregonian of the immigration of '44; George
Williams, of Salem, was second lieutenant of the Fourth
Infantry, and in the second battle of Bull Run, Antietam,
Frederickburg, and Gettysburg, losing a foot at Gettysburg;
Frank W. Thompson, of Linn County, was colonel
of the Third Virginia Volunteers in 1863; Henry Butler,
of Oakland, was a member of the eighty sixth Illinois
Volunteers; Charles Harker was a lieutenant; Roswell
C. Lampson, still living in Portland, was the first naval
cadet from Oregon, and served with conspicuous gallantry
and fidelity throughout the war; Capt. W. L.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Dall, of the steamship Columbia, was appointed a lieutenant
in the navy; and many of the regular army officers,
whose northwestern service is indissolubly connected
with its early history, rose to great eminence during the
progress of the war.</p>

<p>"Notable among them was Rufus Ingalls, who became
lieutenant colonel on McClellan's staff; Captain Hazen
and Lieutenant Lorraine, who was wounded at Bull Run.
Grant, Sheridan, Augur, Ord, Wright, Smith, Casey,
Russell, Reynolds, and Alvord, all became generals, as
well as Stevens, who had received a military education,
but was not in the regular army."</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of this paper to follow the patriotic
service of the First Oregon Cavalry during the long and
wearisome months and years during which they labored
in heat and cold, in storm and sunshine, under pioneer
and frontier hardships, in chastising the hostile Indians,
guarding the immigrant caravans, or holding in check the
forces of disunion and secession. That there was need
of them, for all these high and patriotic duties, there is
no doubt.</p>

<p>As early as shortly after Lincoln's election in 1860,
Senator Gwin, of California, with the undoubted knowledge
and coöperation of Joseph Lane, of Oregon, formulated
a plan for a slave-holding republic on the Pacific
coast, with an aristocracy similar to the old Republic of
Venice, vesting all power in a hereditary nobility, with
an executive elected from themselves.</p>

<p>Should the Southern States succeed in withdrawing
from the Union and setting up a Southern Confederacy
without war, then with a continuous line of slave territory
from Texas to the Pacific, the Pacific coast should
combine with the South; but if war ensued between the
North and South, then the coast should be captured, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the Venetian Republic be inaugurated separately, and
slaves imported from the Isles of the Sea.</p>

<p>Bancroft, the historian, asserts that but for the strong
restraining advice of Jesse Applegate and the overwhelming
sentiment against him on his return, there is no doubt
but what General Lane would have embarked in the enterprise,
and that the boxes of arms and ammunition
which accompanied his return were intended for that
purpose. In 1862 it became known all through the Pacific
coast that an oath bound secret organization of confederate
sympathizers were holding almost nightly meetings
at many places; and self-appointed Union detectives,
from points of vantage could hear the tread of martial
feet and the hoarse notes of command.</p>

<p>High authority has asserted that Gwin of California,
Lane of Oregon, and a man named Tilden of Washington,
were the instigators and advisors of this second
movement to steal the Pacific coast from the Federal
Union and hold it for the forces of disunion and secession.
They chose for a title the quaint and striking
name of "Knights of the Golden Circle."</p>

<p>One of the best posted historical authorities on the Pacific
coast told me a few days ago that he had in his possession
cipher documents of that strange disloyal order,
which some day experts should decipher and give to the
world, but as yet it was too early for history to record
anything but the things that were notorious. The same
authority told me of how one night in San Francisco,
eight hundred Knights of the Golden Circle, armed to
the teeth, had met to make the initial outbreak, capture
the Benicia Arsenal and arm all rebel sympathizers of
San Francisco therefrom and carry out the long cherished
plan of seizing the Pacific coast for disunion.</p>

<p>At the last moment realizing the awful, momentous
responsibility of their projected attack they clamored for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
a leader whom they could follow as one man. In a moment
one name was on every lip, an old hero of the Vigilante
days&mdash;in haste he was sent for (he was not a
member of their order) and their plan revealed to one
whom they thought disloyal like themselves, but they had
reckoned without their man&mdash;he was as loyal as the
sturdy patriots who fell at Bunker Hill, fighting the
earlier battle of freedom with bare hands and clubbed
muskets.</p>

<p>Knowing that by a brief delay only could he lull them
to security, and at the same time save the day for the old
flag, he asked until 9 o'clock the next morning to give
his answer, they to remain where they were until his
answer should be returned. Taking this as a practical
assent, and that he only went to arrange his private
affairs, the balance of the night wore on; but the old Vigilante
was not idle; calling together as many of the old
Vigilante Committee as were available and of known
loyalty, he unfolded the treason that was lurking in the
city's midst, and as they were swift to act in the days of
'49, so were they now; the loyalty of the commandant
at the Benicia Arsenal being questioned, he was promptly
replaced by one of true and tried steel, and loyalists
were armed and ready in more than one secret place
in the city midst if needed and then at 9 o'clock as agreed
the answer went to the waiting Knights of the Golden
Circle that the old Vigilante could not be their leader.</p>

<p>Thus all up and down the Pacific coast there was work
to be done by the troops at home in guarding against the
spirit of disloyalty which fostered by the early reserves
of the Union arms was dangerous and threatening.</p>

<p>The situation of Oregon at this time was one of peculiar
danger. Both England and France were in open
sympathy with the states in revolt. The French Government
were setting up an empire in Mexico. England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
was causing trouble over the disputed boundary at the
entrance to Puget Sound. Not a single fort or coast or
river defense existed in either Oregon or Washington,
and at any time these hostile foreign powers might combine
with the Indians as they had done in earlier wars
and with the disloyal and disaffected within. Separated
by such vast reaches of country from the loyal states of
the Union nothing of assistance could be expected from
them in case of trouble, in time to be effective and hence
it was that for upwards of three years, not merely the
peace and security of Oregon but its permanency as a
part of the Federal Union depended on the First Cavalry.</p>

<p>The War Governor, Addison C. Gibbs, a strong and
patriotic man, organized a valuable addition to the military
forces of the State in a state militia, whose chief duty
was to hold in check the Knights of the Golden Circle, to
which it was a direct antithesis.</p>

<p>At the second election of President Lincoln it was a
known fact that the Knights had their arms cached in
the neighborhood of the leading polling places, and intended
to carry the election by force of arms. This was
only prevented by the militia who were superior in numbers
and who adopted similar tactics which proved effective.</p>

<p>One shudders at the fratricidal bloodshed and awful
guerilla warfare that would have come to pass in this
mountainous and thinly settled country had the first outbreak
happened and the torch of rebellion been lighted.
That it did not so come to pass was another evidence of
the mysterious workings of Divine Providence.</p>

<p>In 1864 Governor Gibbs called for ten companies to be
known as the First Oregon Infantry, each company to
consist of eighty-two privates, maximum, or sixty-four
minimum, besides officers. Eight companies were ultimately
enlisted, and at first were chiefly employed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
garrison duty throughout the Northwest, but later performed
gallant service in the Indian wars that were ever
in progress.</p>

<p>I wish that it were possible within the necessary limits
of this article to write down some of the many deeds of
matchless heroism wrought by the loyal men of the
Northwest in the dark days of the war&mdash;deeds fit to rank
with the gallantry of Sheridan's dashing troopers, with
the glorious achievements of Sherman's March to the
Sea, with the steadfastness of the iron phalanxes of the
immortal Grant. But we can at least pay our tribute of
praise to those rude frontiersmen of the Pacific, who
loved their country, their country's flag, and the cause
of freedom,&mdash;who fulfilled, without murmur, the self-sacrificing
duty placed upon them by the martyr President,
who wrought out in blood and fire the destiny of the
Northwest, and whose only reward has been the sense of
duty done. Of each of them the beautiful words of
Tennyson are peculiarly appropriate:</p>

<h3>THE GREAT WEST AND THE
TWO EASTS.</h3>

<p>A resounding chorus of gratulations will herald to the
world within the next two years the first centennial of
two events upon which the history of the Great West is
founded&mdash;the purchase of Louisiana and the expedition
of Lewis and Clark to the mouth of the Columbia River.
Whether the student of history at the Saint Louis World's
Fair in 1904 pause in admiration of the political foresight
of Jefferson, or join in the general acclaim of the
heroism of our first explorers at Portland, in 1905, the
fact that will most impress him is that geographical lines
have been obliterated and there is no West. Migrations
having their origin in the dim, remote past, and continuing
down to the present, have brought the Aryan race
face to face on the opposite shores of the great western
ocean, and the world finds itself confronted with that
condition which William H. Seward predicted, when,
addressing himself to the commerce, politics, thought,
and activities of Europe, he said they "will ultimately
sink in importance, while the Pacific, its shores, its
islands, and the vast regions beyond, will become the
chief theater of events in the world's great hereafter."
The East that Columbus sailed westward from Spain to
discover will ever be the world's East; the West, "the
remote shores that Drake had once called by the name
of New Albion," will be the East of the World's Great
East, and the West only in its geographical relation to
the Atlantic seaboard of our own country.</p>

<p>The West has fulfilled every promise of its value to
the Union made by its champions when its cause was
before the people of the new Republic; it has refuted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
every prediction of dire effect made by the opponents of
its acquisition. When the purchase of Louisiana was
under consideration, the fear was expressed that people
who would move to that region would scarcely ever feel
the rays of the general government, their affections
would be alienated by distance, and American interests
would become extinct. The generous response of men
and money made by Missouri, Kansas, and Iowa, when
the Union was in the throes of a struggle for its preservation,
attests the loyalty of the Louisiana region. A
Southern senator asked, in 1843, what good was Oregon
for agricultural purposes, and said he would not give a
pinch of snuff for the whole territory. Yet the Oregon
Country has given the Union three sovereign states, and
part of its territory has been taken to form two other
states; its occupation by Americans was a direct cause
of the annexation of California; it has in the Columbia
River and Puget Sound two important bases for military
and naval operations; far from being inhospitable to the
honest farmer of the Atlantic seaboard, or the Ohio
Valley, it has one hundred thousand farms, valued at
nearly $600,000,000. Alaska was denounced as a barren
waste, that would never add one dollar to our wealth, or
furnish homes to our people. Yet in less than forty
years Alaska has supplied gold, fish, and furs worth
$150,000,000, and has paid revenue to the government
exceeding by $1,500,000 the price Russia got for it in
1867; and at no distant day Hawaii and the Philippines
will justify American occupation by statistics as telling as
those here presented of Louisiana, Oregon, and Alaska.</p>

<p>If a nonexpansive policy had prevailed in our national
councils at the beginning of the nineteenth century; if
the presidential chair had been occupied by another than
the broad statesman who saw beyond the Mississippi,
over the Rockies to the Pacific, and over the Pacific to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
the cradle of the world, we should now have an intolerable
situation of affairs in North America. Had we refused
Louisiana from Napoleon, what is now the United
States would be partitioned, geographically, about as follows:
East of the Mississippi would be the Republic of
the United States of America of 1783, with England in
Canada on the north, and Spain in Florida and fringing
the Gulf of Mexico. Louisiana would have fallen into
England's hands as a result of the Napoleonic wars, and
so, perhaps, Oregon, either by reason of a favorable interpretation
of the Nootka convention, or Vancouver's
discoveries. Mexico, as the successor of Spain, would
own Texas and all the remainder of the west south of the
forty-second parallel and not included in Louisiana.
With a republic on one side, and European sovereignty
on the other, the Mississippi would to-day be bristling
with cannon. The purchase of Louisiana was political
foresight, and the completion of our title to Oregon was
a direct result of the Louisiana transaction. The war
with Mexico was the logical sequence of both. From
whatever point we may regard it, the acquisition of the
trans-Mississippi region, viewed in the perspective of a
century, was worth what it cost in money, actual war,
and risk of war with what, in the early stages of our
history was the most powerful nation on the globe.</p>

<p>The beginnings of the West date from 1850. Further
back the census reports do not present statistics that can
be compared for valuable purposes, with present standards,
although as early as 1840 there were nine hundred
thousand people along the western shore of the Mississippi
in Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, and Missouri. These
states were long on the firing line of American civilization,
and their people subsisted by general farming, or
by outfitting ox-train merchandise caravans for Santa Fé
and Chihuahua, or by outfitting and trading with pioneer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
settlers <i>en route</i> to Oregon, or gold seekers flocking to
California. Jim Bridger put up in southwestern Wyoming
in 1843 the first post for the purpose of trading built
west of the Mississippi River, and its establishment
marked the beginning of the era of emigration to the Far
West. Until a comparatively recent period a goodly portion
of the public domain lying west of the Missouri
River, and comprising perhaps five hundred thousand
square miles, was mapped as the "Great American Desert"
and they who penetrated its solitudes and returned
unscathed to "civilization" were regarded with that
curiosity that pertains to a traveler who has visited an
unknown land. With the upbuilding of the country and
the spread of knowledge of its capabilities, the title of
"Great American Desert" has been swept away, and the
colored maps that illustrate the books of the twelfth census,
regard the white portion as "unsettled area." This
includes a considerable area in every state and territory
west of the ninety-ninth degree of longitude. East of
that line the only white portion is in southeastern Florida.
Progress in the half-century comprehended in this brief
review has been remarkable and the present position of
the West is strikingly shown in the appended statement,
which represent its percentages of the total for the United
States for the different items tabulated. In a few instances
comparisons are made with 1890 and 1850:

<p>The proportion of native born, which suffered a sharp
decline between 1850 and 1890, because of the influx of
foreigners to the mines of California, Montana, and Nevada,
and to the farm lands of Minnesota and the Dakotas,
is again in the ascendant, the net gain for the
decade just ended having been 2.7 per cent. The native
population is largest in the group of southwestern states
and territories, Arkansas leading with 98.9 per cent;
Indian Territory, 98.8 per cent; Louisiana, 96.2 per cent;
Oklahoma, 96.1 per cent. Along the Pacific coast it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
highest in Oregon, with 84.1 per cent, and lowest in California,
with 75.3 per cent, Washington coming in between
with 78.5 per cent. North Dakota, with 64.6 per
cent, makes the poorest showing. The proportion of
natives in the West as a whole in 1900 was 1 per cent
above the average for the Union, which was 86.3 per
cent. The per cent of foreigners is highest in North
Dakota, where it is 35.4, and lowest in Arkansas, where
it is 1.1. Minnesota is the only State having to exceed
500,000 foreigners. California and Iowa have over 300,000
each.</p>

<p>The population of the West in 1850 consisted of 1,500,000
farmers and traders in the Louisiana country, that
is, Missouri, Iowa, Arkansas, Minnesota; 200,000 odd
who had swarmed into Texas after it had been wrested
from Mexico, some 60,000 in New Mexico, a group of gold
diggers in California, a few thousand Mormons in Utah,
and a handful of hardy pioneers who had braved privations
and hostile savages on the plains in following the
footsteps of Lewis and Clark to the Oregon country. At
that time there were not quite 2,000,000 people in all the
boundless region west of the Mississippi River. The
establishing of direct communication by the overland
stage, followed by the building of the transcontinental
railroad, stimulated growth, and by 1870 the West had
attained considerable importance in population. In 1850
it reported 8.6 per cent of the total population of the
Union; 26.6 per cent in 1890, and 27.5 per cent in 1900.
In 1890 it had over four times the population of the
new Republic in 1790 and not quite twice the population
of the nation in 1820. In 1900 its population was somewhat
under that of the whole country in 1850, the ratio
being about 21 to 23. The appended table shows how
the several states and territories of the West have progressed
in the matter of population:

<p>Louisiana, with 11.4 inhabitants to the square mile,
was the most thickly settled state in the West in 1850.
Missouri followed with 9.9; Arkansas with 4, and Iowa
with 3.5. The average for the Union was 7.9. That
year the little State of Delaware, with 91,532 inhabitants,
boasted of one two hundred and sixty-third part of the total
population of the Union. Where was Oregon with about
one seventh of Delaware's population and Minnesota
with less than one half of Oregon's? In 1900 the density
of the Union was 25.6 inhabitants per square mile.
Three western states, Missouri, with 45.2, Iowa, with
40.2, and Louisiana, with 30.4, exceeded the general
average. In the remainder of the states the density
ranged from 0.4 in Nevada to 24.7 in Arkansas.</p>

<p>The colored population of the trans-Mississippi region
is largely confined to the states in the southern belt,
Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. In the Pacific states the
colored population is principally Chinese and Japanese.</p>

<p>Throughout the West, with the exception of Louisiana,
the number of females to each 100,000 men is under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
national average, which is 95,353. Louisiana reports
98,871, and Utah, for obvious reasons, follows with
95,324. Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Texas also
have between 90,000 and 95,000 females to each 100,000
men, and in Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Indian
Territory, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, the average is
over 85,000 and under 90,000. The proportion of women
to each 100,000 men is exceedingly low in the Pacific
coast and mountain states, being 80,987 in California;
73,265 in Idaho; 62,390 in Montana; 65,352 in Nevada;
77,495 in Oregon; 70,329 in Washington; 59,032 in
Wyoming. Alaska reports 38,629.</p>

<p>Here, as in other parts of the Union, urban population
is growing faster than rural. Comparison for this discussion
is with the census of 1870, as the returns for any
previous year would make too meagre a showing. In
1870 the West had 56 of the 226 places that reported a
population of 4,000 and over. In 1890 the number was
176 out of 899, and in 1900 it was 251 out of 1,158. Of
the West's total population in 1900, 20.3 per cent was
urban, against 37.3 percent for the Union. In 1900, 17.6
per cent of the total urban population of the country lived
in the West, 13.1 per cent in 1890, and 14.1 per cent in
1870. California with 48.9 per cent and Colorado with
41.2 are above the average for the Union, while Washington,
with 36.4 makes a close approach to the mark.
For other states the average is: Iowa, 20.5; Kansas,
19.2; Louisiana, 25.1; Minnesota, 31; Missouri, 34.9;
Montana and Wyoming, 28.6; Nebraska, 20.8; Oregon,
27.6; Utah, 29.4; Arkansas, 6.9; Idaho, 6.2; Nevada,
10.6; North Dakota, 5.4; South Dakota, 7.2; Texas,
14.9; Arizona, 10.6; Indian Territory, 2.5; New Mexico,
6.1; Oklahoma, 5. The following statement shows the
drift of the population into the cities:

<p>In 1870 Saint Louis, New Orleans, and San Francisco
were the only cities that had over 100,000 population.
In 1900 ten cities exceeded 100,000, while eight other
cities, Portland leading the contingent, had between
50,000 and 100,000. Since 1880 Seattle has advanced
from one hundred and fifty-first place to forty-eighth
place in the rank of American cities; Los Angeles from
one hundred and thirty-fifth to thirty-sixth; Duluth
from one hundred and fifty-second to seventy-second;
Kansas City, Kansas, from one hundred and fifty-fifth to
seventy-sixth; Portland from one hundred and sixth to
forty-second; Tacoma from one hundred and fifty-seventh
to one hundred and fourth; Spokane from one hundred
and fifty-eighth to one hundred and sixth, and Dallas,
Texas, from one hundred and thirty-seventh to eighty-eighth.
So rapid is the growth of Portland and Seattle
that before many years they must take position among
the country's twenty largest cities.</p>

<p>The new farms opened since 1850 are nearly equal in
the aggregate to the land area of the original thirteen
states. The new farms opened between 1890 and 1900
are more than the combined land areas of the states of
Tennessee and West Virginia. North Dakota, with a
little over 300,000 population, has more land by 1,500,000
acres under farms than has all New England with 5,600,000
people. The average number of improved acres per
inhabitant more than doubled in the West between 1850
and 1890 and showed in 1900 a slight increase over 1890.
In the older agricultural states it is steadily decreasing.
Thus, in New England it fell from 4 acres in 1850 to 1.4
acres in 1900; New York from 4 to 2.1 in the same interval.
The Ohio valley states have held up steadier.
Ohio has decreased from 4.9 to 4.6, and Illinois from 5.9
to 5.7. Indiana has increased from 5.1 to 6.6.</p>

<p>The West has 2,056,748 farms compared with 1,491,405
in 1890, and 119,510 in 1850. Texas, with 352,190, leads
the Union, and Missouri, with 284,886, holds second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
place. Iowa has 37,000 more farms than all the New
England states combined. While the West has not quite
half the improved acreage of the country, it has 63 per
cent of the unimproved acreage or 269,000,000 acres out
of 426,400,000 acres. Farms average in size from 93.1
acres in Arkansas to 885.9 acres in Montana, 1,174.7
acres in Nevada, and 1,333 acres in Wyoming, where
stock raising predominates and requires large ranges.
The average for the West is 229.1 acres against 146.6
acres for the Union.</p>

<p>The proportion of the total land area in farms ranges
from 3.7 per cent in Nevada to 97.4 per cent in Iowa.
Kansas has 79.7, Missouri 77.3, Texas 74.9, Oklahoma
63, Nebraska 60.8, and Minnesota 51.8. No other State
has 50 per cent. In the Rocky Mountains and Pacific
states the average, considering the capabilities of the
soil, is surprisingly low. California reports 28.9, Washington
19.9, Oregon 16.6, Wyoming 13, Montana 12.7,
Utah 7.8, and Idaho 5.9. Iowa leads the Nation in this
respect, followed by Indiana with 94.1, Ohio with 93.9,
and Illinois with 91.5. It is from these four states, whose
areas are so largely taken up and whose land values are
high, that the extreme West is seeking by reason of its
cheap lands and equable climate, to draw its new population.
East of the Mississippi River the percentage
ranges in New England from 32.9 in Maine to 80.8 in
Vermont. Along the Atlantic coast the average is from
59 per cent in New Jersey to 85 per cent in Delaware.
Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois have already been shown in
comparison with Iowa. Kentucky has 85.9, Tennessee
76.1, Wisconsin 57, and Michigan 47.8. Florida with
12.6 and the District of Columbia with 22.1 are the only
percentages reported from east of the Mississippi River,
that look like western figures. Values follow:

<h4>MANUFACTURING.</h4>

<p>The center of area in the United States, excluding
Alaska and recent acquisitions, is in northern Kansas,
the center of population in Indiana, and the center of
manufactures in Ohio. The center of area will always
be in the West and the centers of population and manufactures
are slowly moving that way. Manufacturing
is of minor importance, though the aggregate of output
exceeded the agricultural output in 1900 by over $50,000,000.
Relatively its position is not so strong, being but
16.1 per cent of the total, against 27.5 per cent for population
and 43.2 per cent for value of farm products.
Manufacturing increased substantially in the 1890 and
1900 decade and materially in the past fifty years. Thus,</p>

<p>Missouri is the principal State for this branch of industry,
California second, and Minnesota third. These
states stand for nearly half the total output of Western
factories. The output of California, Oregon, and Washington,
in 1900, was $435,670,399, constituting 3.3 per
cent of the value of products for the United States.
Commenting on this, we find the census of Manufactures
(part 1, page CLXXVIII) saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The industrial condition in this group of states in 1900, considering
the value, but not the character of the products, was about the same
as the New England states in 1860 and the Middle states in 1850. From
this point of view, the growth of the Pacific states has been remarkable.
The character of its industries is still determined largely by
its natural resources of farm, forest, and mine, but the recent wars in
the Orient, resulting in the opening of new markets, gave to the industries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
of this section a great stimulus which had only begun to be
felt at the time the twelfth census was taken.</p>
</div>

<h4>COMMERCE.</h4>

<p>The combined imports and exports of the United States
in the year ended June 30, 1901, were geographically distributed
as follows: New York, 45.73 per cent; other
ports east of the Mississippi River, 35.24 per cent; the
West (Pacific and Gulf ports), 19.03. Of the seven great
ports in the Union, three are in the West, New Orleans
ranking the third, Galveston sixth, and San Francisco
seventh. New Orleans has a foreign commerce of $173,000,000
a year; Galveston $102,000,000, and San Francisco
$70,000,000. Puget Sound and the Columbia River,
which before many years will be large ports, have between
them $40,000,000. Of the total exports of the
United States in 1901, the West reported $354,682,075,
or 23.1 per cent. Imports were $86,275,443, or 10 per
cent. Breadstuffs form a considerable item of the exports
of Western ports. For the ten years ended June 30,
1901, shipments were 240,000,000 bushels of barley, corn,
oats, rye, 450,000,000 bushels of wheat, and 26,000,000
barrels of wheat flour, of a total value of $521,000,000.
San Francisco led in this business, with New Orleans
second, and Portland, Oregon, third.</p>

<h4>MINERAL PRODUCTIONS.</h4>

<p>Ever since the discovery of gold in California in 1848
mining has been one of the most important industries of
the West. Between 1848 and 1900 California yielded
gold valued at $1,385,197,097, about one eighth the total
gold production of the world from 1493 to 1900. The
West in 1900 produced 99.6 per cent of the Nation's gold,
99.8 per cent of its silver (commercial value), and 15.1
per cent of its coal, viz:

<p>Other mineral productions are 30,000,000 tons of coal;
200,000 short tons of lead; 413,000,000 pounds of copper;
3,600,000 barrels of petroleum, and 30,000 flasks of quicksilver.
The copper mines of Montana and Arizona have
lessened the importance of the Lake Superior region as
a source of supply, cutting its percentage of the total
American output from 62.9 in 1862, to 25.9 in 1899.</p>

<p>One of the greatest gold mining regions of the world
is located in eastern Oregon, covering a gross area of
between 3,000 and 4,000 square miles. Prof. J. Waldemar
Lindgren, of the United States Geological Survey,
believes that the strong, well-defined veins upon which
most of the important mines of this region are located will
continue to the greatest depths yet attained in mining.</p>

<h4>LUMBER INDUSTRY.</h4>

<p>According to the census reports for 1900, lumber is excelled
in value among American productions only by iron
and steel, textiles and slaughtering and meat packing.
The West, having 607,500 square miles, or 55.4 per cent
of the total wooded area of the country, exclusive of
Alaska, will surely be paramount in this important industry.
Indeed, we, this early, find the Director of the
Census making this important admission in one (203) of
his bulletins:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The white pine area in the Northwest has passed its maximum of
production and the attention of lumbermen is being diverted from this
region to the Southern pine forests and to the enormously heavy forests
of the Northwest coast, which will, in the course of a decade or
two, become the chief source of lumber for the country.</p>
</div>

<p>Texas, with 64,000 square miles, leads the Union in
wooded area. Oregon is second, with 54,300 square
miles, and Minnesota third, with 52,200 square miles.
Arkansas, California, Missouri, Montana, and Washington
each have over 40,000 square miles of wooded area.
Oregon, Washington, and California have at least one
third of the standing timber of the country, but they cut
less than ten per cent of the total lumber product. The
redwood forest of California is, perhaps, the densest forest,
measured by the amount of lumber per acre, in the
world. In quantity of standing timber, Oregon leads
the Union with 225 billion feet; California second with
200 billion feet, and Washington third with nearly 196
billion feet. Minnesota, with a product of $43,600,000
leads the West and Washington is second, with $30,300,000.
The total value of the lumber product of the West
in 1900 was $184,135,988, against $109,201,667 in 1890
and $6,075,896 in 1850. The lumber cut was 10,925,736
M feet, board measure, or a little less than one third
of the output of the Union. Among Western states,
Minnesota led with 2,342,388 M feet, Arkansas second
with 1,623,987 M feet, and Washington third with 1,429,032
M feet. Oregon cut 734,528 M feet.</p>

<h4>RAILROAD TRANSPORTATION.</h4>

<p>The transcontinental railroads have brought the West
up to its present state of development, for they have
opened it to settlement, and provided reasonable rates for
the transport of its products to the Eastern markets, even
if at the same time they have exposed its infant manufacturing
industries to the competition of the large capitalization
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
of the Atlantic seaboard and the Ohio Valley. In
1850 the West had 79½ miles of railroad, all in Louisiana.
All the rest of the westward stretch of the nation to the
Pacific was without so much as a single rail. What
Louisiana could so proudly boast of in 1850 was less than
the mileage operated by the Boston and Maine and its
branches in Massachusetts that same year. By 1900 the
total had swelled to 87,406.13 miles out of the 193,345.78
miles in the United States and the percentage from .25 to
45.2. On the basis of miles of railroad per 100 square
miles of territory Iowa leads with 16.56 and Nevada is
lowest with .83. In miles of line per ten thousand inhabitants
Nevada is first with 214.98, and Louisiana last
with 20.44.</p>

<p>In view of the enormous railroad construction in the
West in the past thirty years it is worth while to recall
President Buchanan's telegram to John Butterfield, the
pioneer of Western overland transportation, when the
first direct overland mail arrived by stage at Saint Louis
from San Francisco October 9, 1858:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I cordially congratulate you upon the result. It is a glorious triumph
for civilization and the Union. Settlements will soon follow the
course of the road, and the East and the West will be bound together
by a chain of living Americans which can never be broken.</p>
</div>

<h4>FINANCE.</h4>

<p>In 1850 there were thirty-one banks west of the Mississippi;
twenty-five in Louisiana and six in Missouri,
with deposits aggregating $9,500,000. It is difficult to
figure the condition of the people with regard to money
as statements of private banks are obtainable in only a
few states and the national banks are the only guide.
On July 16, 1902, the individual deposits in these
amounted to $639,180,306, and the loans and discounts
to $615,116,949.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<h4>FUTURE OF THE WEST.</h4>

<p>The future of the Great West must be considered from
two view points: (1) In its relation to the Asiatic countries
and their trade; and (2) in its ability to support a
large population. These will be taken up in their order.</p>

<p>Asia and Oceanica comprise an area of 21,262,718 square
miles, and have a population of 847,000,000, or more than
half that of the globe. Of this number, 435,000,000 are
in China and its dependencies, Japan, Asiatic Russia and
Corea. Asia, and the islands of the Pacific, annually
buy from the world goods valued at $1,446,000,000 and
sell to it goods of a value of $1,436,000,000, representing
a total trade of $2,882,000,000. The United States
will in time have a tremendous trade across the Pacific,
although at present our proportion of the business is inconsiderable.
In the year ended June 30, 1901, only
9.25 per cent of our foreign commerce was with Asia and
Oceanica, of which 2.17 per cent was with the British
East Indies; 2.09 per cent with Japan; 1.67 per cent
with Chinese ports, and .37 with the Philippines. The
new theatre of the world's activities is a virgin field, as
little understood on our Pacific seaboard as on our Atlantic
seaboard, for the exporters of both sections make
the same mistakes in packing, and in long range dealing
with the Oriental customer, to whom the first essential
in trade is what our consular officers persistently pour
into unwilling ears as the "look see," or the privilege of
inspecting the commodity offered for sale, before buying
it. These, however, are details of commercial organization
which our exporters can be depended upon to settle
on a satisfactory basis. The fear expressed in some
quarters that the opening of Siberia by the completion
of the great Russian railroad, and the consequent development
of a region that will become a competitor of the
United States in the trans-Pacific country, would appear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
to be groundless so far as any detrimental effect upon
our country is concerned. Our general development is
based upon the attraction of our institutions, the freedom
of industry, the cheapness and fertility of our lands,
hospitable climate, and above all, to the long enjoyment
of the guarantee of peace. No other country in the
world can offer the same inducements to progress and no
country in the world can compete with us on our own
terms.</p>

<p>Viewing the future of the West from the point of its
ability to support a large population, the measure must
be the record of the half-century just past. It has done
more than its most sanguine friend dared foretell of it a
century ago and it is not half developed. Excluding
Alaska, it has an area of 2,138,488 square miles and a
population of 20,971,062, with a density of 9.8. The
population density of the Union is 25.6 to the square
mile. The West is capable of reaching this mark and on
this basis its population would be, approximately 55,000,000,
a little more than the states east of the Mississippi
had in 1900. Every foot of the West is useful for some
purpose, the purpose depending in some degree upon the
success of irrigation. The high lands of Nevada are no
more to be ignored in the general scheme of economy
than the irregular and broken surface of Vermont, where
intensive cultivation of the soil now obtains as a result of
Western competition in agriculture. When one contemplates
the rugged mountains of Idaho, eastern Montana,
northern California, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado,
and New Mexico, he should reflect that some where in
this broad land cattle must have range if the price of
meat is to be kept within bounds. Conditions for horticulture
and agriculture in Louisiana are as favorable as
in any other State in the Union. The Columbia-river
basin in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho is an empire in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
itself, with a population less than Chicago, and eastern
Oregon, under irrigation, could produce 100,000,000
bushels of grain. There are those who expect Alaska to
take station as an agricultural community. Manufactures
in the West will ultimately bear a close ratio to
population. Commerce will depend largely upon the
effort the Nation in general makes across the Pacific.</p>

<p>The West comes on the stage of the world's activity in
an era of peace, prosperity, and advancement of American
principles and institutions. Its loyalty to the Union
never has been doubted and no cloud of discord appears
to bring it into contest with the East, for its interests are
identical with those of that section, and community of
interest promotes community of purpose. The West, instead
of proving the Nation destroyer, has proved its
savior. What the future is in all its aspects, no man can
say. The Briton would have been thought insane ten
years ago who would have dared to predict the day that
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand would be called
upon to uphold the prestige of the empire at the Cape of
Good Hope. No American, however pessimistic, contemplates
with pleasure the possibility of war, still every
American is pleased to see his country protected against
the day of war. The generation that was contemporaneous
with the statesman who said Oregon was not worth
a pinch of snuff left sons and daughters to see an Oregon
regiment sailing away from San Francisco to plant the
Stars and Stripes at Manila and raise the United States
to the dignity of a world power. In that city whose
legislative halls echoed with dire warnings if Louisiana
should be accepted from Napoleon, the citizens of some
future day may be gladdened to the heart by the sight of
a regiment from the Yukon River marching down the
broad avenues to the defense of the national capital.</p>

<h3>SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC HISTORY
OF ASTORIA.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>On a peninsula flanked by Young's River and the
Columbia, ten miles from the broad Pacific, is situated
the historic city of Astoria. Its beginning dates back
to April 15, 1811, when an expedition sent from New
York by John Jacob Astor founded a fur-trading post on
the present site of the city, and erected a stockade and
buildings for the use of the traders. For a short time
all went well with this little pioneer settlement, and a
profitable trade was carried on, despite the murder of the
crew of the Astor Company's vessel, Tonquin, and the
destruction of the vessel off the coast of British Columbia.
The Indians became enraged on account of the
treatment accorded them by the captain, and set upon
and murdered the crew, with the exception of Mr. Lewis,
the ship's clerk, who, though mortally wounded, after
inducing the Indians to come aboard again, set fire to
the magazine and blew up the ship and its swarm of
savages.</p>

<p>Soon after this, the second war with Great Britain
started, and the members in charge at Fort Astor, thinking
they would be captured by the British war vessels
then on the coast, and that their goods would be confiscated,
sold their interest and that of Mr. Astor to a
rival company, known as the Northwest Fur Company,
and controlled by British subjects. Soon after this transfer
was made the British warship Raccoon appeared in
the river, and on December 12, 1813, took formal possession
of Astoria in the name of Great Britain, and named
it Fort George.</p>

<p>In accordance with the terms of the treaty of Ghent there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
was to be a mutual restoration of all territory captured
during the war. When the question of the restoration
of Astoria or Fort George came up England contended
that Astoria had been transferred in a commercial transaction
between an American and a British company, but
this contention was not pressed against the American
claim that the settlement of Astoria by an American
company confirmed that title already secured by the discovery
of the Columbia River by Captain Gray in 1792,
and by the exploration of Lewis and Clark in 1805. The
United States again took possession of Astoria August 9,
1818, and the formal transfer was made October 6, 1818.</p>

<p>Astoria was now a very small settlement, consisting of
a stockade and a few shacks, but bearing the high sounding
titles of Astoria and Fort George, the latter being
the property of the Northwest Fur Company.</p>

<p>In 1821 the Hudson Bay Company and the Northwest
Fur Company were consolidated, and in 1824 Dr. John
McLoughlin was placed in charge of Fort George. At
this time the fur trade was carried on chiefly with the
tribes of the interior, and it was the custom for the agents
of the company to carry the goods to the Indians. Under
the circumstances Doctor McLoughlin saw that the chief
trading post should be farther inland, near the head of
navigation, and moved to Vancouver, Washington, leaving
a trader in charge of the company's property at
Astoria, whose duty it was to watch for the company's
vessels, and to send the pilot, Indian George, out to meet
them and to pilot them to Vancouver.</p>

<p>With the departure of the fur company, Astoria became
a lookout station and a trading post of very little
importance. Mofras describes it in 1841 as "a miserable
squatter's place, invested by the rival American and
English factions, with the pompous name of Fort George
and town of Astoria, the fort being represented by a bald
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
spot, from which the vestige of buildings had long since
disappeared, and the town by a cabin and a shed."</p>

<p>This condition was soon to be changed, for the trains
of immigrants were beginning to arrive in the Willamette
Valley, and some were to push on to the extreme western
limit of the continent. In 1843 J. M. Shively came to
Astoria and took up a claim in what is now the heart of
the city, and known as Shively's Astoria. He was followed
by Col. John McClure, who took the claim joining
the Shively claim on the west, and now known as McClure's
Astoria, and A. E. Wilson, who located on the
claim to the east of Shively's claim, and now known as
Adair's Astoria. These three men and James Birnie,
the trader, in charge of the Hudson Bay Company's
station, were the only white men in Astoria in 1844.
Soon after this Robert Shortess located on the land now
known as Alderbrook, and a Mr. Smith located at what
is now known as Smith's Point. Mr. Birnie lived in
the company's building, situated near the present site of
Saint Mary's Hospital, Colonel McClure lived in a small
cabin just to the south and east of where the Baptist
Church now stands, and Mr. Shively, "who didn't believe
in joint occupancy, which disturbed the social relations
between Mr. Birnie and himself," lived at "Lime Kiln
Hall," on the ridge near the eastern limit of his claim.
Mr. Wilson lived in a cabin in Upper Astoria. There
were several settlers on Clatsop Plains at this time, among
the number being D. Summers, Mr. Hobson and family,
Rev. J. L. Parrish, Messrs. Solomon Smith, Tibbets,
Trask, and Perry. Ben Wood, N. Eberman, and other
young men held claims on the plains, but lived elsewhere.</p>

<p>Astoria the fur-trading post now ceased to exist; Astoria,
the town, was started. Astoria's real beginning,
from which resulted a city, dates back, then, only to the
early forties when the homeseekers first settled here. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
1846 James Welch and family and David Ingalls arrived.
Mr. Welch took possession of the Shively claim during
Mr. Shively's absence in the East and divided the claim
into city lots as Mr. Shively had previously done. This
led to a dispute over the ownership of the claim which
was finally settled by an equal division of the claim between
the two interested parties.</p>

<p>When J. M. Shively returned from the East in 1847 he
brought with him his commission as postmaster and
opened the first post office west of the Rocky Mountains
in the Shively building, still standing on the east side of
Fourteenth Street, between Exchange Street and Franklin
Avenue. The next year S. T. McKean, wife, and six
children arrived and took up their residence here. In
this year also the news of the discovery of gold in California
led to a stampede to the mines and while some of
the inhabitants of Astoria went, their places were soon
filled by people brought here by the great increase in the
amount of shipping done from Columbia River. A great
demand for lumber and provisions arose and mills were
started to supply this demand. Hunt's mill, just below
Westport, had commenced operations in 1846, and when
the gold excitement started, had one hundred thousand
feet of lumber on hand which was eagerly purchased at
$100 per thousand. The Milwaukie mill and Abernethy's
mill at Oak Point supplied the greater part of the lumber
for the California trade. In 1849 Marland's mill, just
above Tongue Point, was started. This mill was later
destroyed by fire. In 1851-52 James Welch and others
built the first mill in the city proper. It was located in
the block bounded by Commercial, Bond, Ninth, and
Tenth streets. It was afterward owned by W. W. Parker
and known as the Parker mill.</p>

<p>The increase in the amount of shipping led to the establishment
of the customhouse at Astoria in 1849. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
same year Captains White and Hustler arrived and
brought the first pilot boat to operate on the Columbia-river
bar, the Mary Taylor. The pilots had their headquarters
at Astoria, and this led to increased trade for
Astoria and the establishment of boarding houses for the
accommodation of the shipping men and the passengers
of vessels that stopped here either to await favorable
wind to proceed to up-river points or to cross the bar or
to complete their cargoes of lumber or increase their cargoes
of provisions with a few barrels of salt salmon.</p>

<p>When Col. John Adair, the first collector of customs,
arrived at Astoria he occupied the McClure house and
tried to secure land from the different owners of the town
on which to build the customhouse. The owners refused
to donate the land and fixed the price at a figure which
Colonel Adair considered too high. The result of this
disagreement was the establishing of the United States
customhouse at Upper Astoria and the beginning of the
rivalry between the upper and lower towns, which lasted
for many years, and led to the building up of two towns
mutually jealous of each other yet having every interest
in common. Judge Strong, who passed through Astoria
in 1850, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>When Astoria was pointed out as we reached the point below, I
confess to a feeling of disappointment. Astoria, the oldest and most
famous town in Oregon, we had expected to find a larger place. We
saw before us a straggling hamlet, consisting of a dozen or so of small
houses irregularly planted along the river bank shut in by the dense
forest. We became reconciled and indeed somewhat elated in our
feelings when we visited the shore and by its enterprising proprietors
were shown the beauties of the place. There were avenues and streets,
squares and public parks, wharves and warehouses, churches and
theaters and an immense population&mdash;all upon the map. Astoria at
that time was a small place or rather two places&mdash;the upper and the
lower town&mdash;between which there was great rivalry. The upper town
was known to the people of lower Astoria as Adairville. The lower
town was designated by its rival as "Old Fort George or McClure's
Astoria." A road between the two places would have weakened the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
differences of both, isolation being the protection of either. In the
upper town was the customhouse; in the lower town two companies of
United States engineers, under command of Major J. S. Hathaway.
There were not, excepting the military and those attached to them
and the customhouse officials, to exceed twenty-five men in both
towns. At the time of our arrival in the country there was considerable
commerce carried on, principally in sailing vessels, between the
Columbia River and San Francisco. The exports were chiefly lumber,
the imports merchandise.</p>
</div>

<p>The United States census of 1850 gives Astoria a population
of two hundred and fifty-two, which number included
the two companies of United States engineers
stationed here and probably a number of transients.</p>

<p>I have before me a photograph of a painting copied
from a daguerreotype picture of Astoria taken in 1856.
This picture was taken from a spot near where the Parker
House now stands and shows a wharf and a dozen houses.
The wharf was known as the Parker wharf and extended
from the Parker mill in a northeasterly direction to a
point just north of the Occident Hotel. This was the
first wharf erected in Astoria and was built in the early
fifties. The picture also shows the old Methodist Church
which was built in 1853-54, a cooper shop, the Shively
house, the present residence of Judge F. J. Taylor, and
the buildings occupied by the United States troops during
their stay here. A few houses were not shown in the
picture, those in the then western part of the town and
those in upper town.</p>

<p>Astoria was now assuming the proportions of a town
and in 1856 was incorporated by the territorial legislature.
The town included the Shively claim and a part of
the McClure claim.</p>

<p>With the incorporation of the Astoria and Willamette
Valley Railroad in 1858 by T. R. Cornelius, W. W. Parker,
John Adair and others began Astoria's struggle for rail
connections with other parts of the state and with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
East which ended with the completion of the Astoria and
Columbia River Railroad in 1898.</p>

<p>No census returns were handed in for Astoria in 1860,
but the estimated population was about two hundred and
fifty. The troops had been removed before this so that
the town had had a substantial growth caused chiefly by
the increase in the amount of shipping and the trade
with the small growing settlements near Astoria. Astoria
was becoming the trade center for all points on the
lower Columbia. The fishing industry was confined still
to the smoking and salting of salmon and a considerable
quantity was shipped to the Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p>J. M. Shively, who had been appointed postmaster in
1847, left for the mines in 1849 leaving his deputy, David
Ingalls, in charge of the office, who moved the office to
his store on the southwest corner of Tenth and Duane
streets. At this time Astoria was the distributing office
for the entire Northwest, including the present states of
Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana. In 1853 San
Francisco was made the distributing point for the coast.
T. P. Powers, who resided in Upper Town and was a part
owner in that place, succeeded Mr. Shively as postmaster
and moved the post office to upper town near the customhouse.
This left Astoria without a federal office and
helped to build up its rival. With the change of the
national administration in 1861, new officers who were
friendly to the lower town were appointed and the post
office and the customhouse were moved to the lower town.
It was remarked at the time by a resident of lower town
that "politics took them away and politics brought them
back."</p>

<p>The erection of Fort Stevens and Fort Canby at this
time made work plentiful around the mouth of the river
and contributed to the growth of Astoria both in population
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
and in wealth, as many of the supplies were drawn
from the town.</p>

<p>The school census for the years 1859-70 shows a steady
growth in population brought about by the establishment
of new enterprises, the settlement of the country tributary
to the town, and the increase in amount of shipping
from the Columbia River, especially the establishment of
a regular line of steamers from Portland and Astoria to
San Francisco. In 1865 Christian Leinweber started the
Upper Astoria tannery which gave employment to about
thirty persons. In 1867 what was afterwards known as
the Hume mill was built near Thirteenth and Commercial
streets and was one of the city's most important resources
until its destruction by fire in 1883.</p>

<p>In 1867 Judge Cyrus Olney, who had succeeded to the
claim of John McClure, formulated a plan to dispose of a
part of this property at a uniform price per lot. This
plan was known, locally, as the Olney lottery. Tickets
were sold for $50 each, entitling the holder to a lot in the
city and a chance to draw the "grand prize," which consisted
of two lots and a house, the property now owned
and occupied by Louis Kirchoff and situated on Twelfth
Street, between Exchange Street and Franklin Avenue.
The other lots were situated in different parts of McClure's
Astoria. The plan then amounted to this: each
ticket entitled the holder to a lot, though the location
was a matter of chance, and a chance to win two lots
and a house. Many lots were disposed of by means of
this lottery.</p>

<p>By 1870 the population of the town had increased to
six hundred and thirty-nine, and the population of Clatsop
County had increased from four hundred and sixty-two
in 1850 to one thousand two hundred and fifty-five
in 1870. Small sailing vessels and steamboats were running
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
between Astoria and lower river points, and a regular
steamer service was maintained between Portland
and Astoria and between Portland and San Francisco.
At this time it was customary for the ocean steamers to
make the trip from Portland to Astoria during the day,
and to tie up at Astoria for the night, and to cross the
bar the next morning. Steamer day was the event of
the week and was a source of considerable revenue to the
merchants of the town.</p>

<p>The Pioneer and Historical Society was organized in
this city in 1871, and, as the name implies, its membership
is limited to the pioneers of Oregon, and its object
is to prepare and keep a record of the events in which
the pioneers figured during the founding and development
of the State. Many records were collected by the
society, but for the most part have been scattered and
lost, as have the books of its once valuable library. For
several years past the society has had merely a nominal
existence, but recently a movement has been started to
reorganize the society, and to carry out the purposes for
which it was founded, especially in the way of collecting
local history.</p>

<p>The <i>Astorian</i>, the successor to Astoria's first newspaper,
<i>The Marine Gazette</i>, published during the sixties, was
first published in 1873, and has been issued continuously
since that time. Its influence in the upbuilding of the
town can not be estimated. The early files of the paper
are filled with articles encouraging new enterprises, setting
forth the advantages of the town, and recording
every new step in its advancement.</p>

<p>The question of title to the water frontage became a
troublesome one when the town began to grow and buildings
were being erected along the water front. The original
settlers thought they had title to this land by virtue of
their patent from the United States; but later it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
learned that the State of Oregon had title to all land between
high and low-water mark. By a legislative act
passed in 1872 the State authorized the sale of its property
in front of Astoria to the owners of the property immediately
back of the tide land, or to those who had purchased
their land from such owners and had made improvements
thereon. The price asked was nominal.
During the years 1873-76 most of this land was purchased
from the State, and the city placed in a position to use
the property best suited for cannery sites and wharves.</p>

<p>By the terms of the new city charter, passed in 1876,
the limits of the city were extended so as to include
Shively's claim, Hustler and Aiken's Addition, and all
of McClure and Olney's Addition. In 1891 the boundaries
were again changed so as to include Upper Astoria,
Alderbrook, all the land between Alderbrook and John
Day's River, and Smith's Point. The city was bounded
at this time by the Columbia River, John Day's River,
Young's Bay and River, and a line connecting John
Day's River and Young's River. These boundaries remained
until 1899, when all the land east of Van Dusen's
Addition was cut off from the city.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1874 the first grain ships to take their
entire cargo from Astoria were loaded by R. C. Kinney
&amp; Sons. This fleet consisted of the British ship Vermont
and three other vessels. The same year the Astoria and
Willamette Barge Company was formed for the purpose
of carrying wheat in barges and steamers from the farms
in the Willamette Valley to the vessels at Astoria. The
company built the "Farmer's Wharf" on the site of the
present dock and warehouse of the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company. This company lacked the capital
to carry on this enterprise and after loading a few ships
sold out to the Oregon Steam Navigation Company. The
promoters of the barge company expected to transport a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
ship load of wheat to Astoria for less than the cost of
towage and pilotage between Portland and Astoria.
Since this time some of the larger grain vessels have completed
their cargoes here, but this port has not been made
a starting point for the grain fleet.</p>

<p>While the experiment with the wheat shipping was
being tried another industry was rising into importance,
the one that more than any other has contributed to the
growth of the town. In 1866 four thousand cases of
salmon had been packed. The following year eighteen
thousand cases were packed on the Columbia River, and
this important industry was established and by 1874 it
had reached the proportions of an extensive commercial
transaction. Astoria's share in the salmon packing business
began with the erection of Badollet &amp; Company's
cannery in Upper Astoria in 1873. This cannery did
not run the next season. A. Booth &amp; Company built
the second Astoria cannery. Devlin &amp; Nygant's, R. D.
Hume &amp; Company's, and Kinney's were built in the
order named and all were in operation in 1876. Trullinger's
mill was built during this year and Astoria now
boasted of two large mills, five canneries, and a tannery.
During the two years, from 1874 to 1876, the population
of the town nearly doubled and many new buildings,
consisting of canneries, warehouses, and dwellings, were
erected. There was much money in circulation as every
one had money and the fishermen were prodigal with
theirs. Small change was seldom used, the quarter being
the smallest coin in general use. This was the period
of Astoria's greatest growth. From a small shipping
station in the sixties it had grown to be a town of about
two thousand people, controlling the most important industry
on the lower Columbia and holding a large trade.
Improvements followed as a matter of course. In 1876
the Western Union Telegraph Company completed its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
line between Portland and Astoria, and Robert Mason &amp;
Company constructed a building and entered into the
production of oil from salmon heads. During this year
a new enterprise was started at the canneries of M. J.
Kinney and Hanthorn &amp; Company, that of canning beef
and mutton. At Kinney's from September, 1876, to
January, 1877, nineteen thousand five hundred cases of
beef and five hundred cases of mutton were packed. This
industry seems never to have gotten beyond the experimental
stage in Astoria, owing largely to the difficulty of
securing cattle at a fair price and to the lack of facilities
for and experience in handling the meat. During the
season of 1877 there were eleven canneries in operation
in Astoria and more than a thousand fishing boats were
in use on the river. Just before sundown, during the
fishing season, the river would be covered with white
sailed boats, all sailing briskly along on their way to
their favorite drifts.</p>

<p>Houses during this year were in great demand, and
many were built. The <i>Astorian</i> thus speaks of the building
boom:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It may seem surprising, but nevertheless it is true, work is progressing
in all stages upon one hundred and eighty-nine new buildings
in the city of Astoria at this moment. * * Were we to attempt to
enumerate the long list of structures erected in this city since last
fall we should fail to do the subject justice. In building wharves and
warehouses, canneries, and other packing establishments, ship yards,
and machine shops, stores, and residences, many thousands of dollars
have been spent.</p>
</div>

<p>And again:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Houses are being erected at an alarming rate. Last Saturday ten
new structures were raised&mdash;one for every working hour of the day.</p>
</div>

<p>The river trade, a very important factor in the upbuilding
of the city, had greatly increased during the past
three years. Twenty or more steamers, large and small,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
were engaged during 1878 in making daily trips between
Astoria and lower river points and upper river points as
far as Portland. At this time seven steamers were
making regular trips between Portland and San Francisco,
but stopping at Astoria and bringing many passengers
and much freight to the town. The <i>Astorian</i> of
May 5, 1877, commenting on the number of people arriving
at Astoria, says "last month two thousand six hundred
and twenty-eight bona fide immigrants landed at
Astoria by steamers. About one thousand seven hundred
proceeded inland in search of homes." This was about
the beginning of the fishing season, and no doubt most
of those who remained at Astoria were fishermen and
cannery workers. The people at that time remained in
Astoria during the fishing season, and returned to California
for the winter.</p>

<p>The effect of having such a large floating population
was soon felt on the morals of the city, and it was during
these early years of the salmon industry that Astoria
acquired the reputation for vice and crime that remained
long after the city had rid itself of its undesirable element.
During the year 1877 there were forty saloons in the city,
and all reaped a rich harvest during the fishing season.
The <i>Astorian</i> was strong in its protests against the immorality
of the town, and urged the closing of all the
dives and gambling houses, but for a time without avail.
Later we shall see how the city did rid itself of its lowest
class of inhabitants.</p>

<p>In 1878 the roadway to Upper Astoria was completed,
and the Upper Astoria post office abolished. The completion
of the roadway was an event of great importance
to the people of both towns, and had the effect of putting
an end to the rivalry that had existed since the starting
of Upper Astoria in 1849, when the customhouse was
built. The towns were now in fact one, though considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
locally as two separate towns. By the legislative act of
1891 the corporate limits of the town were extended so
as to include upper town.</p>

<p>The intense rivalry between the companies operating
steamers on the Portland-San Francisco route brought
about the reduction of freight and passenger rates so that
there was much travel between Oregon and California.
As every steamer stopped several hours at Astoria the
town received considerable patronage from the passengers.
The <i>Astorian</i> speaks of the town being crowded
during the stay of one of the ocean steamers. The Great
Republic frequently carried a thousand passengers, and
always took on a considerable part of its cargo at Astoria.</p>

<p>The population of Astoria in 1880 was two thousand
eight hundred and three and the population of Clatsop
County seven thousand two hundred and twenty-two.
This increase in the number of people in the county meant
much to Astoria, since the supplies for a large part of
Clatsop County are taken from the city.</p>

<p>In 1883 the salmon industry reached its highest point.
Not only were more fish canned than at any previous year
but a better price than ever before was paid for the raw
material, thus distributing a larger amount of money
among the fishermen and cannery workers. During this
season six hundred and twenty-nine thousand cases of
salmon, valued at over $3,000,000, were packed on the
Columbia River.</p>

<p>It was during this year that the fire, known locally as
the "big fire," occurred. It started July 2, 1883, in the
sawmill near the site now occupied by the Foard &amp; Stokes
Company and swept the entire water front from that
point east to Seventeenth Street, including the large warehouse
owned by the Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company. The volunteer fire department worked heroically
and succeeded after several hours in gaining control
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
of the fire, though not until it had destroyed several
blocks of business houses, wharves, and dwellings. The
wooden streets, built on piling over the water acted as a
means for carrying the fire from building to building.
The loss was very heavy but the fishing season was at its
height and money plentiful, so that in a short time new
buildings were erected in place of those destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>An interesting chapter in Astoria's history is connected
with the fire of 1883. During its progress a large quantity
of liquor was taken from the saloons in the path of
the fire and carried to places of safety only to be stolen
by the rougher class of onlookers. In a short time great
disorder prevailed in the vicinity of the fire and the officers
were powerless to prevent the wholesale stealing of
the goods taken from the stores and houses. Drinking
was kept up throughout the night but after the fire was
checked the scene of disorder was transferred to the lower
part of town, known as "Swilltown." Here the drunken
fishermen were soon relieved of their money by the denizens
of this section. Later some of the fishermen threatened
to burn the rest of the town in retaliation. The
business men of the city fearing that this threat would
be carried out organized a committee to assist the officers
in preserving the peace should their aid become necessary,
the mayor at the same time issuing a proclamation
calling upon all saloon keepers to close their saloons each
night at 12 o'clock. One saloon, owned by Riley and
Ginder, two ex-policemen, refused to obey and when the
officers went to arrest the proprietors they were fired
upon through the barricaded doors. During the conflict
three taps were sounded on the fire bell, the signal for
the citizens' committee to assemble. The committee responded
quickly and arrived upon the scene fully armed
and ready for action. The officers in the mean time had
succeeded in entering the building and had arrested Riley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
and Ginder who were brought before the committee.
After a short deliberation they were informed that they
must leave the city at once under penalty of being hanged
from the city hall. The threat was sufficient and they
closed their saloon and left the city. To one who knows
the condition of affairs that existed in the city after the
fire, and the character of the men who led the citizens'
movement, it is evident that Riley and Ginder used the
best of judgment in obeying promptly. After disposing
of this case the committee decided to drive out the crowd
of disreputable characters that lived in "Swilltown," and
accordingly served notice on all such to leave town within
twenty-four hours. This order, backed by a resolute set
of citizens, was generally obeyed, only one man openly
defying the committee. This man, an Englishman by
the name of Boyle, was known as a "bad man." Nevertheless
he was captured, whipped, and sent out of town.
Recognizing three members of the committee he brought
suit against them in the United States court for damages
and secured the verdict. The amount was quickly raised
by general subscription, $20 being the usual individual
contribution. The citizens' committee having accomplished
the purpose for which it was organized now disbanded.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the steady decline in the salmon pack
on the Columbia River since 1883 and the closing of
many of the canneries in the city, Astoria has had a steady
growth, due in a great measure to the increase in trade
with the growing towns and the farming and dairy districts
tributary to the city, and to the growth of the sawmill
industry, which though still in its infancy here, is
growing rapidly. By the close of the summer four and
possibly five large mills will be in operation.</p>

<p>In 1890 the city had a population of six thousand one
hundred and eighty-four, a very great increase over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
census returns of ten years before. Two years before this
the Astoria and South Coast Railroad was started and
the road built from Sea Side to the middle of Young's
Bay, a distance of about fifteen miles. Though this road
did not enter the city for several years its building had a
marked effect on Astoria. Prices for city property increased
very rapidly, and during the years 1889 and 1890
a real estate boom was in progress. While considerable
property changed ownership very little building was done
so that when the period of activity in real estate ended
the city did not contain rows of empty houses as did so
many of the boom towns of Washington.</p>

<p>Almost from the beginning of its history Astoria has
dreamed of rail connections with the East. The coming
of the railroad has been regarded as the one thing needed
to make Astoria the seaport of the Northwest. The Astoria
and South Coast road had stopped near the center
of Young's Bay. About three years later a new road that
was to run up Young's River, thence through the Nehalem
Valley to Portland was started. This company, after
building several miles of trestle around Smith's Point
and up Young's River, suspended operations owing to
its inability to secure sufficient financial backing to complete
the road. The Astoria and Columbia River Railroad
Company was given subsidy of a million and a half
in money and property and in 1898 built the present road
to connect with the Northern Pacific track at Goble.
The city has been greatly benefited by this road, although
the long expected period of rapid growth did not accompany
it, owing to the fact that Astoria has not been made
a common point with other cities of the Northwest.</p>

<p>The population of the city in 1900 had increased to
eight thousand three hundred and eighty-one. A conservative
estimate places the population now at a little
over ten thousand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>This is substantially the story of Astoria's settlement
and growth, both in wealth and population. It remains
now to trace the influence of its main industry, salmon
packing, in determining its social conditions. In Astoria
foreigners and native born of foreign parentage form the
great majority of inhabitants. Representatives from
almost every part of the world live in Astoria, the principal
nationalities, however, being Norwegians, Swedes,
Danes, and Finns. The Finns form a greater part of
our population than any other nationality.</p>

<p>During the first thirty years after the real growth of
the city began the population was almost exclusively
American, but with the advent of the fishing industry
came the hardy fishermen and sailors of northwestern
Europe who found here an opportunity to carry on their
customary avocations with the assurance of profitable
returns for their labors. During the first few years of
the salmon business a great number of fishermen came
from other states, so that Astoria had a floating population
of nearly two thousand during the summer months.
They were a free and easy set who made money and
spent it without reserve, the saloons getting a large share
of their earnings. As a result saloons flourished, carrying
with them their many kindred evils, and Astoria became
a rough place. The foreigners who in more recent years
have engaged in fishing are, as a class, sober and industrious,
and home builders. Gradually these adopted
citizens have displaced the transient fishermen, until
now the term fisherman is no longer synonymous with
rowdy, but rather indicate a hardy, industrious citizen
of foreign birth. In Upper Astoria and Alderbrook the
people are mostly Scandinavians, or descendants of this
race. In Union or Finn town, as the name implies, the
people are almost exclusively Finns. They are progressive
and almost to a man own their own homes, not shacks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
or hovels, but well built, roomy houses. These people,
as well as the Scandinavians, come from a country where
the public school system is well established, and are
zealous in the cause of the public schools of this city. A
year ago the people of Union town attended the annual
school meeting almost in a body, and succeeded in carrying
through a measure and voting a tax for the construction
of a school building in the west end of the city, at
the same time offering to donate a considerable part of
the necessary labor. The present Taylor school building
is the result of these efforts.</p>

<p>In the last city election, out of a total of eleven hundred
names registered, nearly six hundred were of foreign
birth. Of this number one hundred and seventy were
natives of Finland, eighty-seven of Sweden, seventy-two
of Norway, sixty-four of Germany, and forty of Denmark.
The Finns are very clannish, which accounts for their
almost exclusive Finnish settlement in West Astoria. It
is their custom to send for their relatives in their own
country as soon as they have earned the necessary money.
In this way the foreign born population is steadily increasing.
They do not appear to be a speculative class,
but seem content to work hard, secure a home and save
something from their yearly earnings though a few cooperative
companies have been formed for the purpose
of packing salmon.</p>

<p>The struggle for material advancement in the way of
developing resources, securing a railroad, and other enterprises
has not been greatly aided by the foreign population.
Since the coming of these foreign-born citizens
the fishing element is no longer regarded as a rough class
of people, but rather as the sober, working class of the
city. During the winter months most of the fishermen
are employed carpentering, street building, as workers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
in the mills and factories or engaged in knitting nets and
preparing gear for the next season.</p>

<p>Astoria at the present day is a cosmopolitan city of
about ten thousand inhabitants, composed largely of foreigners.
As in earlier times fishing is the main industry,
though the rapidly growing lumber industry bids fair
soon to surpass it in importance. At the present time
there are only seven canneries in operation in Astoria,
but the cold storage business has assumed large proportions
during the past two years. Astoria now possesses
an excellent water system, a thorough school system,
consisting of six grammar schools and a high school,
all together accommodating about fifteen hundred children
and employing thirty-one teachers. Trade with the
surrounding country has increased very rapidly during
the last few years, but Astoria has been but little benefited
by the increased export trade from the Columbia
as most of the cargoes are shipped direct from Portland.
During the ninety-two years of its existence Astoria has
grown from a small fur-trading station to the second city
in size in the State. While its growth has been apparently
slow, it has kept pace with the development of Oregon
and the Northwest as a whole.</p>

<h3>A PIONEER CAPTAIN OF INDUSTRY
IN OREGON.</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The material from which this paper has been prepared was derived
from the following sources: manuscript account of "Woolen Mill," the "Journey
to Washington," and the "Cargo of Wheat to Liverpool," written by Mr. Watt
and loaned to the author by Mr. S. A. Clark, of Washington, D. C., in whose possession
it has been. A series of articles in the <i>Oregonian</i> in 1881, by Mr. S. A. Clark,
describing the journeys across the country and other incidents, obtained from
manuscript and from conversations with Mr. Watt, with whom Mr. Clark was
on most intimate terms; a paper containing recollections of his brother's life and
incidents by Ahio Watt, of Portland; conversations with the widow and daughter
of Mr. Watt, who are now living at Forest Grove, Oregon.</p>
</div>

<p>A unique place in the industrial history of Oregon must
be given to Joseph Watt, the first to undertake the manufacture
of woolen goods on the Pacific coast and the first
to send a cargo of wheat to the market at Liverpool, both
of which acts mark the beginning of important industrial
and commercial policies in the history of Oregon.</p>

<p>Joseph Watt, or "Joe," as he is more commonly called
by those who mention him in connection with the history
of Oregon, was born at Mount Vernon, Knox County,
Ohio, on the 17th of December, 1817. His earliest ancestor
in America was a silk weaver of Scotch-Irish descent
who came to this country about 1760, settling in the
vicinity of Philadelphia. His grandfather, Joseph Watt,
crossed the Alleghany Mountains in 1802 and took up a
donation claim in western Pennsylvania. His father,
John Watt, who had taken part in the war of 1812 and
served with Perry in his first cruise on the Great Lakes,
migrated to Knox County, Ohio, in 1815. Here he
married and reared a family of ten children, of whom
Joseph was one.</p>

<p>As a boy Watt seems to have been always a dreamer,
building castles in the air and planning great schemes of
business and adventure. Because of these dreams of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
verdant fields and herds of cattle, he desired to join the
movement for the settlement of Texas, then being effected
under the leadership of Sam Houston, and was prevented
only by the ill health of his father and the large family
which needed his aid. As a sort of compromise his
father agreed to migrate to Missouri in 1838. This move
resulted only in hardship and privation, and soon young
Watt was turning his thoughts again toward the prairies
of Texas. In the winter of 1840 and 1841 he started south,
stopping in the country of the Creeks and Cherokees to
earn money at his trade of carpentering. It was at this
time that the Oregon country was coming prominently before
the people in Missouri. Watt became interested and
returned to his home with the intention of migrating to
Oregon. On his way through the southwestern part of
the State in the spring of 1843 he came in contact with
many who were planning to start that year. Senator
Lewis F. Linn, of Missouri, had introduced a bill into
the Senate in 1838 providing for the settlement of Oregon
and offering six hundred and forty acres of land to
each settler. Watt read all that he could find upon the
subject, listened to everything which he could hear and
talked much with his associates. By the spring of 1843
he was ready to start, but his father had become equally
anxious to better his condition and proposed that the
whole family prepare to go the following year. By the
spring of 1844 it was clear that the expense of so long
and difficult a journey could not be met, and Watt, unwilling
to defer his hopes longer, started with two companions,
expecting to earn his way across the plains by
driving the teams or cattle of well-to-do emigrants. The
assets all told with which he started on this long journey
were $2.50 in cash and a stock in trade of a pair of new
boots, some pins and fishhooks, to be used in trade with
the Indians.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>Watt had succeeded in securing employment as driver
for a well-to-do emigrant, but fell out with his employer
before they had gone far. With a job here and there,
and a trade to his advantage, he managed to reach Burnt
River with a cow and a rifle to his credit. As the journey
neared the end however provisions grew scarcer, and those
who possessed them were less able or willing to share with
others. Finding that he was not welcome at the camps
of the emigrants, and obedient to vigorous hints, he
started ahead with a single companion and began the
dangerous and difficult journey over the Blue Mountains.
The snow lay from twelve to eighteen inches deep, and
the trail could only be followed by scratches made on the
trees by wagons that had passed over before. Watt's
moccasins had given out and were mended with leather
cut from his buckskin pants. For provisions they had
but a loaf of bread between them. The rifle was useless
because there was no game in the mountains. His cow
had been left in the charge of a friend in a party behind.
All difficulties were surmounted however and the valley
of the Umatilla was reached. Here they were in the
region of game. A number of prairie chickens were shot,
powder was traded to the Indians for a few potatoes, a
kettle was borrowed and the weary travelers gave themselves
over to a feast, which, at intervals, was prolonged
through the night. Their spirits rose when hunger was
appeased, and they knew that soon they would be at the
mission station at Waiilatpu. Ragged and disreputable
in appearance they were not cordially received, and the
independent nature of Watt ever cherished a dislike for
missions and missionaries. Remaining at the station
until the party having charge of his cow arrived he
effected a trade by which he secured a supply of provisions
for the last part of the journey to the Dalles, where
he expected to take a boat down the river. Various experiences
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
were yet to be met. Fate decided that he
should partake of but a single meal from the supply of
provisions which he had earned so dearly. He escaped
death by the arrival of unexpected help when he was
grappling with an Indian in which encounter the expectoration
of tobacco juice figured as a peculiar weapon of
defense. Finally, however, he reached the Dalles where
boats belonging to the Hudson Bay Company were at
anchor. Those who had money to pay their passage were
packing their goods on board and going themselves, but
the chances for a passage for a penniless and ragged
traveler were small. It was Watt's purpose to work for
his passage and he made application to the boatman.
"You are like one of those worn out oxen," was the reply,
"you haven't strength enough to hold yourself up, let
alone work;" and the boatman went on with his loading.
Sitting on a rock by the river Watt was a despondent
figure. But the boatman, turning back with the exclamation
that "it was too bad to leave the poor devil to starve"
for he might have some "come out to him after all like a
lousy yearling in the spring," asked if Watt could sing.
On learning that he could he bade him find a place on
the bow of the boat and earn his meals as best he could.
Under the title of the "figurehead," therefore, he kept
his allotted place on the bow, and by his skill in singing
and telling yarns earned his meals as well as his passage
down the river. One song, entitled "the bobtailed mare,
or the man who went to heaven horseback," made a
decided hit, and Watt fared sumptuously for the remainder
of the journey down the Columbia.</p>

<p>Ever at the van across the continent Watt was the first
of his party to reach his destination at Oregon City, in
November of 1844. A curious spectacle he must have
made as he appeared upon the streets with his walnut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
roundabout, buckskin pants reaching to the knees and
patched with antelope skin, with a red blanket for an
overcoat and woolen hat, so worn in the crown that it
hung about the neck rather than rested on the head.
Such was the young castle builder who had made his
way across the plains with a capital of $2.50 in cash and
a stock in trade of pins, fishhooks, and a pair of new boots.
Such was the picturesque appearance made by one who
was destined to play no unimportant part in the industrial
development of Oregon.</p>

<p>For a time he slept in the shavings of a carpenter shop.
He tried to trade his last possession, his beloved rifle for
decent clothes but failed. One day in his wanderings
along the street he chanced to meet the chief factor of
the Hudson Bay Company, the hero of his life. After a
few inquiries Doctor McLoughlin gave orders to a clerk
to furnish Watt with clothing. "Tut, tut, tut," said the
old man, "what people these Americans are, wandering
vagabonds across a continent. What are they coming
here for? Give him some clothes." After a bath behind
the shade of a neighboring bank of the river Watt
emerged clad in his suit of British corduroy and with all
his preconceived and inherited antipathy toward the
British and the Catholics removed. With the first money
earned from the task of bricklaying, an employment given
him by Doctor McLoughlin, he sought to pay for his
clothes, and purchasing a bath tub, a cake of soap and
some tobacco, which was his one luxury, he had begun
his career as one of the pioneer captains of industry in
Oregon.</p>

<p>It was not long before an opportunity for advancement
presented itself. The Catholic Church on the French
Prairie was then in process of construction and its builders
were in need of a workman competent to complete
the cornice. As Watt was something of an adept at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
carpenter trade he was offered the work of constructing
seven hundred feet of cornice at $3 a foot, when he was on
the point of offering to do it for fifty cents. The return
from this employment was sufficient to give him a financial
start. Not only industrious but shrewd in the matter
of trade, Watt made the most of the opportunity. About
this time the brig Henry came up the river at a time of
high water, with a cargo of goods, among which was a
stock of Seth Thomas clocks, an article for which the demand
was great in this remote region. With the savings
from his carpenter work Watt purchased the lot, and
found little trouble in disposing of them in exchange for
wheat. The harvest for the year had been abundant,
while the demand was small, and the clocks, which had
cost but $4 apiece, were sold for sixty to eighty bushels of
wheat. Shrewdness in anticipating the oversupply of the
one year would be followed by the scarcity of the next was
more than rewarded. Wet weather and other climatic
conditions caused a small supply while a large emigration
increased the demand and the bushels of wheat were in
turn exchanged for the pieces of gold. Thus in the space
of two years the capital of $2.50 had increased to over
$1,000, and the way was open for larger plans.</p>

<p>Watt had never in the meantime ceased his dreaming.
It was not now, however, the broad plains of Texas and
the herds of cattle, but, rather, the luxuriant meadows
and hills of the Willamette Valley, which his imagination
covered with flocks of sheep. Pleased with the opportunities
of a country which had profited him so much,
and desiring his parents and family to come, he started
back to Missouri in the spring of 1847. The return was
also to be made the means of realizing his dreams. It
was his intention to bring back a flock of sheep. Already
he seemed to see the demand that would grow up in a
damp country like Oregon for woolen garments, and perhaps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
likewise, the need of suitable clothing for his eight
sisters. There were but few sheep in the country at that
time. Some were in the possession of the Hudson Bay
Company; others had been driven over in the emigration
of 1844, and possibly there were a few besides. The return
journey was made by the southern route. Evidences
were visible of the terrible sufferings of the party who,
in 1847, had been induced to come that way. Along the
Rogue River the Indians were hostile, and Watt was
enabled at various times to kindle his fire for breakfast
with the arrows which lay thick about the camp. On
the broad plains he was frightened by a band of hostile
Pawnees, but, escaping all danger, at length reached in
safety his home in Missouri.</p>

<p>Before his return to Oregon Watt made a journey to
the East, mainly on business. Boston, however, with its
bleak weather, had few charms for him. "With all their
steamboats, railroads, fine stores, fine cities, fine women
and all, give me Oregon," is the reflection which appears
in the reminiscences of his visit. While in the East and in
the neighborhood of Washington he decided to visit the
national capital and carry back to his fellow pioneers in
the Far West whatever he could learn of the disposition
of the administration toward his country. As this "self-appointed
delegate" was walking about the streets of the
capital city he was indulging in the reflection, typical of
the western spirit, that "a great deal of money was being
spent foolishly in that city." He took occasion to look up
old friends upon whom the city life failed to exert a helpful
influence. His purpose there, however, was not curiosity,
but information that might be of value, and to
gain this he sought admission to the Chief Executive.
President Polk was at the time too busily engaged to give
him audience, and the disappointment was great, for his
reminiscences record the exclamation: "What right had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
he to be busy when I was there, all the way from Oregon?"
Unable to see the Secretary of War, Mr. Davis, for similar
reasons, he finally was advised by his friends to
visit the little brick house, on a back street, which was
occupied by Senator Benton of Missouri. There he felt
he would surely receive a cordial welcome. "I must go
and see Benton," he says: "Haven't I shouted for him
in Missouri, and hasn't he made speeches in favor of
Oregon? Yes, he can tell me what the government is
going to do for Oregon." Admitted into the house by the
colored servant, he stood in the presence of the Senator
whom he thought well named "Burly Benton."</p>

<p>The interview was far from pleasant, if we may judge
from Watt's account. Upon learning the residence of
his visitor, the Senator immediately began a eulogy upon
the services to Oregon of his son-in-law, Colonel Fremont,
which aroused the ire of the westerner. "Ah,
yes," said Benton, "we know all about Oregon. My
son-in-law, Colonel Fremont, has traveled all over that
country. The country is, or ought to be, under everlasting
obligation to him for the information he has given
at the greatest sacrifice a man ever made." To this his
visitor warmly replied: "As to any information given
you by Mr. Fremont regarding what the people are doing
and their prospects, it is certainly guessed at, for I know
he was never there. His map of the road is good, but
when it comes to making roads, he never did. He followed
the road to Oregon made by emigrants, men,
women and children to the Dalles, took bateaux to Fort
Vancouver, got supplies, returned to The Dalles and
struck out for California on the east side of the mountains."</p>

<p>Watt says in his reminiscences that he shall never forget
the look that Benton had on his face as he started
across the room, rubbing his hands and storming, "Perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
I don't know the movements of my own son-in-law."
While the picture is completed by the clerk, to
all intents writing at a desk near by, but whose sides
were "prying out and in like a pair of bellows."</p>

<p>A tribute paid by Watt to the services actually rendered
by Colonel Fremont mollified the old senator and the remainder
of the interview was pleasant. The conversation
turned to the object of the visit which Watt had expressed
to Benton in the following words: "I was in the
neighborhood of the city and was anxious to learn something
about the intent of the government concerning Oregon
so that I could have something to tell the settlers on
my return, for we only get the news once a year." Watt
told him of his plan of transferring his family across the
plains and of driving sheep and introducing the manufacture
of wool. To Benton it seemed "quite an undertaking,"
but Watt, with the true pioneer spirit, replied,
"Yes, but the people out there do not mind hardships
and dangers. Somebody has to do it if the country is ever
settled." To the praises paid by Watt to Oregon and the
need of an extension of government, Benton replied,
"There are a great many things to contend with, I am
afraid, before that can be done. England has to be
treated with, for they have some claims out there; and
we have many designing men here who will give us
trouble. I am sure I do not know how it will be done,
but I think something will be done that will satisfy you
people. I have been frustrated in some attempts to relieve
the country but am still in hopes we can do something."
The conversation then drifted to mutual acquaintances
in Missouri, and Watt left with some maps
and reports of Fremont, presented by the Senator, under
his arm.</p>

<p>The journey by boat down the Mississippi River was
the occasion of another experience. A collision occurred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
just before daylight and many of the passengers, unable
to get to land, were drowned. Watt narrowly escaped
by reaching the hurricane deck and wading out of the
cabin waist deep in the water. "I thought that worse
than all the Indians in the world," is the remark with
which he sums up this experience.</p>

<p>Upon reaching home the preparation was made for
crossing the continent. A band of sheep had been gotten
together during Watt's absence, much to the amusement
of the neighbors, who could not believe the enterprise
would succeed. The progress, indeed, was slow. When
rain fell the mud was deep and in dry weather the dust
was equally trying. "I have driven day after day, pushing
the sheep along by my knees, and could not see them
for the dust," says Watt.</p>

<p>The emigrants of 1848 had a comparatively easy time,
and a comfortable journey. They were more numerous,
were better provided with necessities and better organized
than those of former years. How great the contrast
between crossing the plains in 1848 and that which
had been the occasion of so many difficulties four years
before. The ample outfit consisted of two large freight
wagons with five yoke of cattle to each. There was loose
cattle and sheep and drivers and herders to help with the
work. Watt's familiarity with the route, his knowledge
of the best camping places and sources of water supply
caused many to look naturally to him as a leader, although
the dust that rose from the path of the flock of sheep was
too much for a close following. Watt was a lover of a
practical joke, and his knowledge of the country often
gave him an opportunity to indulge this taste. By his
advice a company of the emigrants had been induced to
camp by the Dry Sandy with the promise that water
would be abundant. When they reached the place there
was none to be seen. The bed of the stream was as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
dry and dusty as a desert. To the surprised and indignant
inquiries of the fellow travelers for water Watt only
said, "I have struck the rock and water will soon be
here." Doubt and despondency, however, were clearly
seen on the faces of the emigrants, and many thought
that they had trusted too far. Those who were fortunate
enough to have kegs of water in possession for such an
emergency now brought them out and began the preparation
of supper. Those less fortunate gathered in groups
where grumbling could be heard in undertones; but
Watt was calm and unconcerned through all. Without
warning, when darkness came on, a thread of ice cold
water that the midday sun had released in the snow-capped
mountains, came trickling down. It grew larger
and larger and shouts on every side arose "Here's water!
Water for all! Moses still lives." The thirsty cattle
rushed in without questioning the source of supply, but
the emigrants touched it reverently, half doubting the
reality of their senses.</p>

<p>The usual vicissitudes of the long but somewhat monotonous
journey across the plains were enlivened one
night by the sudden arrival in camp of a messenger, on
horseback, from the West. He had been riding hard and
seemed anxious to proceed as fast as possible. It was
Joseph Meek, messenger of the Oregon colonists, on his
way to Washington to announce to the government the
Whitman massacre and the Cayuse war. "The Cayuse
Indians have broken out," he said, "and are murdering
far and near, sparing neither man, woman, nor children.
Men are all up from the valley fighting them hand to
hand. Our boys charge and the Indians charge back,
death and destruction at ever charge." The effect of the
vivid account, that none could give better than Meek,
was great. Women and children were frightened and
crying. Even the men questioned the wisdom of proceeding.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Watt, however, being well acquainted with Meek
knew his proclivities for exaggeration when striving for
effect. Gradually the facts were brought out and the
situation, though still serious, was not sufficient to turn
back the emigration. For the rest of the journey Watt
was the most cautious of the party. No Indians appeared
and the fear of the emigrants wore off; but, like
the water from the mountains, the Indians might come
unannounced into camp at any time, as the experienced
traveler across the prairies well knew. Even the seriousness
of this occasion furnished Watt material for his
practical jokes. When the party had exceeded the usual
limit of carelessness in sitting late and burning the camp
fires in the enjoyment of social intercourse, Watt arranged
with the guards of that night a plot. The alarm
for Indians was to be sounded at early dawn. The plan
worked to a charm. The emigrants, who had retired to
rest with a feeling of security, now crept out in confusion
or hid themselves away in ridiculous positions. The
bully of the crowd who had boasted that he "would like
to eat an Injin for breakfast every morning," was now
pushed from the wagon by his delicate wife, with a rifle
in one hand and his pantaloons in the other. The heroine
of the hour was a young girl, Mary Greenwood, the
daughter of one of the reliable men of the party. She
was seen amidst all the confusion kindling a fire and beginning
to mold bullets for the men to use.</p>

<p>The journey was made without mishap to the sheep
until Snake River was reached. Here the current was
strong and they were carried down the stream. The
dreamer of Oregon's new industry stood on the bank,
helpless, and awaited the issue. The enterprise might
easily have terminated at that point; but fate decided
otherwise. One fellow in the flock, with all the qualities
of a leader, struck out for shore with a strong stroke and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
soon the larger part of the flock reached the land and the
wool industry for Oregon was safe.</p>

<p>Without other incidents of importance the journey was
finally ended and the family were all together in their
new home in Oregon. The wool weaver had proved a
worthy successor to the Scotch Irish silk weaver of colonial
days. He had shown the stuff from which new
countries are settled and new industries started. The
sheep, after their long and dusty drive, were placed upon
the rich pastures of the farm in Yamhill County, and to
all appearances were well pleased with the new environment.
The cards and reeds and castings for loom and
spinning wheel were put in place and cloth was made,
sufficient to meet the needs of the family and in particular
of those eight sisters whose needs had played so
important a part in the beginning of the wool industry
for Oregon.</p>

<p>The wise dreamer, however, had been unable to see
fully the future. He had not known that while his plan
was under way the discovery of gold in California had
attracted the notice of the world; that the population
flocking there would cut off the demand for his woolen
cloth, while abundance of goods would come in from the
East by water to increase the supply. The enterprise was
well conceived, but as a financial move it was doomed to
temporary failure. The sheep, however, were here and
could wait for more favorable conditions. "About six
or seven years after the gold mining excitement wore
off," says Watt, "and people began to sober down to the
home business, a few began to think about the prosperity
of the country. We were buying too much and had
nothing to sell. Stock had run down; there was little
inducement to go into wheat largely. We must do something
to prevent so much of an outlay for merchandise
from other countries. Wool was almost worthless and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
there was plenty to keep a small mill going if we could
only get the mill." Being interested in sheep himself
Watt was anxious to make that industry profitable. He
believed that the time had come when woolen goods on a
considerable scale could be manufactured at a profit;
that the cheapness of raw material would overbalance
the high price of labor.</p>

<p>Watt had no personal knowledge of woolen mills but
there were in Oregon, at the time, two millwrights who
understood the subject and were anxious to be employed
in such an enterprise. As the subject was canvassed the
interest grew. In 1855, therefore, articles of incorporation
were drawn up for the erection of a woolen mill to
be located somewhere in the Willamette Valley. Subscriptions
to stock were sought and offers of bonuses
solicited. The articles provided that the capital stock
should be $25,000, and that when $9,000 was paid in a
meeting should be held to decide upon the location of the
mill. A committee of five was appointed to take charge
of the matter. The meeting to decide upon location was
held at Dallas when the requisite amount of stock was
paid in. It was a meeting of considerable importance,
as much rivalry had arisen regarding the location. One
party wished it to be placed on the Luckiamute, west of
the Polk County hills, and the other desired it to be
located at Salem on the east side of the hills. Lively
work had been done; the party favorable to the Salem
location had secured a bonus worth about $7,000 and had
control of the voting stock. Considerable scheming, preliminary
to the vote occurred, and when it was taken
"you could hear a pin drop," says Watt. The result was
favorable to the Salem site, and plans were begun for the
construction. Within a few weeks all the stock was paid
in and the company had possession of a piece of land for
the mill. A board of five directors was elected and orders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
were given to begin the work. The water power was to
be brought from the Santiam River by means of a ditch.
The task was not great as the bed of Mill Creek could be
used and the water power was soon secured. An agent
was sent East to purchase the machinery and by the time
it arrived the building was ready for its occupation.</p>

<p>Before the machinery was placed the introduction of
this new industry was the occasion of a splendid ball in
the spacious building. It was one of the most brilliant
social affairs ever held in Oregon up to this time. Among
the list of those present from all over the territory were
dignitaries of state, including the Governor; dignitaries
from the army, including Lieut. Phil Sheridan, and as
Watt himself says, "even dignitaries from the church
were present." Watt was an inveterate lover of song
and dance, and would go many miles at any time to
engage in such festivities. He was therefore in the height
of his glory, which was not even destroyed by the fact
that his chosen lady, Miss Lyons, beautifully adorned in
a gown of blue velvet, with golden stars, was led to the
dance by the Governor. Indeed, he had no reason to be
uneasy, for the understanding between them was good,
and a few years later, 1860, he was married to her,
dressed for the occasion in a suit of wool made in the
mill which he had done so much to establish.</p>

<p>By the first of May the machinery was in place, and
everything was in running order. Cloth bearing the
name of "Hardtimes" was produced, and the first blankets
ever made west of the Rocky Mountains were sold
at auction. The first pair went to Mr. Watt for $110,
and the others brought $75 to $25. At first all the product
that could be turned out found a ready market; competition,
however, soon set in and the managers of the
mill were undecided what course to pursue. Unwilling
to discontinue the enterprise Watt was consulted, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
agreed to take the entire product of the mill for a period
of three years at a fixed price. By an aggressive process
of advertising, in which he personally carried the goods
into all the important places along the line of the old
Holladay stage route, both in Oregon and California, a
market was created for the goods. In three months after
the agreement had been made the managers of the mill
were willing to give a large consideration in return for a
relinquishment of his contract. The goods found such
ready market that the building and machinery were
doubled. Prices continued to rise; debts were paid off;
the value of the stock rose; a gristmill was built by the
company; the race through the town constructed, and
salaries of officials were raised "as high as their consciences
would allow them to take." A woolen fever
began to spread through the country. Mills were built
at Oregon City, Brownsville, and Ellendale. This was
the period of greatest prosperity. Conditions changed,
but Watt was not then connected with the business.
Divisions had arisen among the stockholders of the company,
and Watt had disposed of his stock in 1866, when
it sold for a value of $800 per share. He continued to
be interested in sheep to the close of his life, and large
flocks of the finest breeds were kept on his farm under
the care of a Scotch herder employed for the special purpose.
He was ever interested in furthering the sheep
industry in other parts of Oregon, and it was partly
through his influence that sheep were first placed upon
the ranges of eastern Oregon.</p>

<p>But the dreams of the dreamer broadened as time
passed. In 1866, when divisions led to his withdrawal
from the woolen mill, the crop of wheat in the valley
was unusually large. The wheat industry had been increasing
for years. Oregon was rapidly passing from the
fur trading and pastoral stages of industrial life to that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
of agriculture. With an ever-increasing supply the market
was restricted, and here was a problem to attract the
mind of Watt. Shipments of wheat were made to California,
but the markets beyond had tempted only the most
daring. One line of steamers had been established between
Portland and New York and four or five vessels
had been drawn into the trade. The Sally Brown was
the first to make the trial and Watt was the man who
gathered up the cargo which she carried from the wheat
fields of the Willamette. Ever in the van through life
Watt conceived the idea that a cargo of wheat could be
sent to Liverpool, the market of the world. With him
to think was to act, and in 1868 he went through the
valley gathering wheat for the first cargo to the greatest
wheat market in existence. It was an adventure in
magnitude exceeding anything that he had tried before.
Failure would mean a heavy loss, and success would
usher in a new day for the industrial life of Oregon.
The cargo was gathered and the vessel set forth on the
long voyage. The destination was reached and the grain
inspected. It was unlike any that had ever been seen
before on the docks of the great market. The inspectors
had never seen kernels of wheat so large. The decision
was pronounced that it could not be right, and the whole
cargo was condemned as water soaked and unfit for the
market. The loss fell heavily upon the consignor of the
cargo, but a beginning had been made that was destined
to grow until Oregon's industrial isolation should be
ended.</p>

<p>In closing this paper it requires but a few words to
sum up the chief characteristics of Joseph Watt. He is
best seen in the narration of his life. Ever engaged in
enterprises that were ahead of his time, he belonged to
the vanguard of industrial development in Oregon. Ever
a dreamer, he met with heavy reverses but yet retained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
a competence sufficient for a comfortable old age. Independent
and genuine in his character, there was no cant
in his make-up. One of the company of kindred spirits
that includes the names of Nesmith, Matthieu, Clark,
Boise, Minto, Crawford, and others, his company was
always appreciated, for he was genial and sociable in
disposition. By the Indians he was loved, and they
gathered about him at his home in Yamhill as they would
about no other. Deeply interested in all that pertained to
Oregon, he was truly one of her benefactors. Always loyal
to the early state builders, he conducted a party of them
in an excursion to the East when the railroad connection
was completed. Always deeply interested in the Pioneer
Association, Watt was its president for a time and rarely
was absent from its meetings. By gift from his widow
the author of this paper has deposited in the vaults of
the Oregon Historical Society the little book in which he
kept the names of the members in their own handwriting.
It is worn and soiled through frequent use, but it will
ever be a valuable reminder of the earliest of our state
builders, as well as a reminder of him whom the author
has chosen to designate as a "pioneer captain of industry
in Oregon."</p>

<h4>TWO WHITMAN SOURCES.</h4>

<p>Correspondence to the <i>New York Spectator</i> which describes
Doctor Whitman as a passenger on board the
steamer Narraganset on Long Island Sound. Doctor
Whitman is on his way from New York to Boston.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
Editorial from the <i>New York Daily Tribune</i> of March 29, 1843.</p>

<p class="center">ARRIVAL FROM OREGON.</p>

<p>We were most agreeably surprised yesterday by a call from Doctor
Whitman from Oregon, a member of the American Presbyterian Mission
in that territory. A slight glance at him when he entered our
office would convince any one that he had seen all the hardships of a
life in the wilderness. He was dressed in an old fur cap, that appeared
to have seen some ten years' service, faded, and nearly destitute of
fur; a vest whose natural color had long since faded, and a shirt&mdash;we
could not see that he had any&mdash;an overcoat, every thread of which
could be easily seen, buckskin pants, etc.&mdash;the roughest man we have
seen this many a day&mdash;too poor, in fact, to get any better wardrobe. The
doctor is one of those daring and good men who went to Oregon some
ten years ago to teach the Indians religion, agriculture, letters, etc.
A noble pioneer we judge him to be, a man fitted to be chief in rearing
a moral empire among the wild men of the wilderness. We did not
learn what success the worthy man had in leading the Indians to
embrace the Christian faith, but he very modestly remarked that
many of them had begun to cultivate the earth and raise cattle.</p>

<p>He brings information that the settlers on the Willamette are doing
well; that the Americans are building a town at the Falls of the Willamette;
that a Mr. Moore of Mr. Farnham's party, some sixty years
of age, was occupying one side of the Falls, in the hope that [the] government
would make him wealthy by the passage of a preëmption law;
that the old man Blair, another member of the same party, was living
comfortably a short distance above, as all who have read Mr. Farnham's
travels will know that he deserves to do. Doctor Whitman left
Oregon six months ago; ascended the banks of the Snake or Laptin
River to Fort Hall, and was piloted thence to Santa Fé by the way of
the Soda Springs, Brown's Hole, the Wina, and the waters of the del
Norte. From Santa Fé he came through the Indians that have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
removed from the States to Missouri. The doctor's track among the
mountains lay along the western side of the Anahuac Range; and he
remarks that there is considerable good land in that region.</p>

<p>We give the hardy and self-denying man a hearty welcome to his
native land. We are sorry to say that his first reception, on arriving
in our city, was but slightly calculated to give him a favorable impression
of the morals of his kinsmen. He fell into the hands of one of
our vampire cabmen, who, in connection with the keeper of a tavern
house in West Street, three or four doors from the corner near the
Battery, fleeced him out of two of the last few dollars which the poor
man had.</p>

From the <i>New York Spectator</i>, Wednesday evening, April 5, 1843.</p>

<p class="center">CRUISING IN THE SOUND.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>: Respecting the goodly Bay State I can say but little,
because since I saw you, I have been only an occupant of steamboat
and railroad cars. I had long supposed that a three-day trip to Boston
was only hereafter to be a notion and reminiscence of olden time,
but alas! I have had the stern reality of things as they "used to was."
I left New York on Monday, in the Narraganset, at the usual time.
We had a rough trip into the Sound, and at 12 o'clock Captain Woolsey,
with sound discretion, carried us into the New Haven Bay, where
we anchored till Wednesday morning, when we proceeded to Stonington,
and on going over [to?] the railroad and finding it in the vocative
case, owing to the outbreak of the waters, we retraced our movements
and again took boat, and made a passage around Point Judith.</p>

<p>It is due to Captain Woolsey and his very gentlemanly aid, Mr.
Richmond, to say that everything was done to make a large body of
disappointed passengers feel happy; good and plentiful meals were
gratuitously provided, and it can hardly be possible that any wayfarer
on this occasion left the Narraganset without a deep conviction that,
under the severe and awkward circumstances of the passage, all had
been done that was possible to obviate the inconveniences and disagreeables
of the passage through the Sound. I would add that the
boat worked well. We had a very pleasant set of passengers. Among
others I may mention the Hon. Robert Rantoul of Boston. This gentleman
is by far the ablest man of the Democratic party in Massachusetts,
and unless I could see him embarked for Salt River, (which I
think must be his final destination,) I would rather have him embark
on the same boat in which I sail, than any other. He is a very interesting,
affable man, of great research, and will, I doubt not, yet render
good service to the country.</p>

<p class="center">THE REV. DR. WHITMAN FROM OREGON.</p>

<p>We also had one who was the observed of all, Doctor Whitman, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
missionary from Oregon. He is in the service of the American Board
of Commissioners of Foreign Missions. Rarely have I seen such a spectacle
as he presented. His dress should be preserved as a curiosity; it
was quite in the style of the old pictures of Philip Quarles and Robinson
Crusoe. When he came on board and threw down his traps, one
said "what a loafer!" I made up my mind at a glance that he was
either a gentleman traveler, or a missionary; that he was every inch
a man and no common one was clear. The Doctor has been eight
years at the territory, has left his wife there, and started from home
on the 1st of October. He has not been in bed since, having made his
lodging on buffalo robe and blanket, even on board the boat. He is
about thirty-six or seven years of age, I should judge, and has
stamped on his brow a great deal of what David Crockett would call
"God Almighty's common sense." Of course when he reached Boston
he would cast his shell and again stand out a specimen of the
"humans."</p>

<p>I greatly question whether such a figure ever passed through the
Sound since the days of steam navigation. He is richly fraught with
information relative to that most interesting piece of country, and I
hope will shortly lay it before the good people of Boston and New
York. Could he appear in New York Tabernacle&mdash;in his traveling
costume&mdash;and lecture on the Northwest coast, I think there would be
very few standing places. Much of his route was on foot and occasionally
on horse or mule back, with a half-breed guide. To avoid the
hostile Indians he had to go off to the Spanish country, and thence to
Santa Fé. A rascally hackman took him in at New York, and carried
him from place to place at his whim and finally put him down near the
Battery, close to his starting point, charging him two dollars, and it
being midnight he succeeded in the vile extortion.</p>

<p class="left65">

account of Doctor Whitman's mission, as given by Mr. Farnham
in his travels in 1839 over the Rocky Mountains. [Fills over one and

<h4>
DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE OREGON EMIGRATION
MOVEMENT, 1842-43.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">OREGON&mdash;PITTSBURGH MEETING AND DOCTOR WHITE'S
REPORT.</p>

<p>The following paragraphs we find in several of the eastern papers
this morning:</p>

<p>"<i>The Settlement of Oregon.</i>&mdash;The meeting at Pittsburgh last week,
reported that it was not expedient for American citizens to emigrate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
to Oregon until the United States Government had taken measures to
secure and protect the emigrants in their rights.</p>

<p>We see, by a letter in the New York papers, that Elijah White, who
went as United States agent to Oregon, and took with him a large party
of emigrants, writes, under date of August 17th, that his party had increased
to one hundred and twelve, although they had lost two, one
by sickness and the other by accident. They started with nineteen
wagons, and their journey had been slow and tedious; but they had
passed two thirds of the way, and were in excellent health and good
spirits. A favorable opportunity for emigration will occur in April,
through the aid of Mr. Fitzpatrick, at Independence. Mr. White advises
those who intend to go to prepare light strong wagons, and to
take no loading except cooking utensils, and provisions for four
months. Mules are preferable to horses. He says no doubt exists as
to ultimate success of the colony."</p>

From the <i>Jeffersonian Republican</i>, September 17, 1842.</p>

<p class="center">THE SETTLING OF OREGON.</p>

<p>We learn with gratification that it is at least rumored that an expedition
is about to be got up in Saint Louis, to colonize the rich and interesting
Territory of Oregon. To such as have so laudable and advantageous
an enterprise in view, we are prepared and feel warranted in saying,
that it rests not upon "rumor" that many of our fellow-citizens of upper
Missouri intend emigrating to that highly celebrated region next
spring, and will no doubt be glad to be joined by as many of the enterprising
citizens of Saint Louis as may think it their interests to join
them.</p>

<p>We learn from the "Oregon Correspondence Committee" of this
place, that already they are beginning to receive names of gentlemen
desirous of joining the expeditions, and from present indications, there
seems to be no doubt remaining that there will be quite a large company
formed. Let not those who now [have it?] in contemplation, draw
back, but steadily persevere, and they may confidently promise themselves
success. The country which they seek is no doubt one of equal
attraction and advantages as any on the globe, and we rest assured
that so soon as the number of inhabitants will justify, the fostering
hand of a territorial government will be extended to it. Up then
every pioneer, and let your cry be "Onward!"&mdash;<i>Western Missourian.</i></p>

<p class="center">LETTER FROM AN OREGON EMIGRATION AGENT TO A
FRIEND AT PITTSBURG.</p>

<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap">Washington City</span>, February 21, 1843.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: Nothing of importance has transpired in Congress since
my last. I am informed by members of the House of Representatives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
that the bill for the occupation and settlement of Oregon Territory
will come before the House this week. It will pass when acted upon.
It was referred to the Committee of Foreign Affairs. John Quincy
Adams, chairman of the committee, reported back the same without
amendment, on the 13th, and, as might have been expected from him,
recommended that the bill do not pass. It is evident, notwithstanding,
that the bill will pass when acted upon. Captain Stine [Steen], commanding
the Dragoons at Fort Leavenworth, has addressed several letters
to Dr. L. F. Linn and others, wishing the Secretary of War to grant
him permission to accompany us with the Dragoons. I have postponed
an interview with the Secretary of War till I am ready to leave for the
West. I have sent many documents to you and others. You will
please send some of them to your friends in Ohio, Wheeling, and other
places, if you have any to spare. I have given the names of the several
committees in Pittsburgh, and west of it, to a number of the members,
who promise that they will continue to send all the documents calculated
to throw light on the subject of Oregon, etc.</p>

<p>I am happy to learn that the citizens of Pittsburgh take so warm an

<p class="center">THE OREGON MEETING.</p>

<p>[The meeting was evidently held on Saturday, February 11th.]</p>

<p>The meeting on Saturday evening at the Council Chamber was
much more fully attended than was expected, the proceedings of which
will be found in our paper. After the organization and the appointment
of a committee to report to the adjourned meeting to be held on
Thursday evening next, William B. Hubbard, Esq., in answer to a call
of the meeting, commenced a most interesting address, prefaced by
offering a resolution complimentary of Doctor Linn of Missouri, and
those senators who stood by him in the advocacy of the bill for the
settlement of this territory. The cry of fire caused Mr. H. to close
his remarks, with a request by the meeting that he would proceed
with them at the next meeting. We hope Mr. H. will prepare a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
synopsis of his remarks for the press. Nothing would be read with
greater interest at this time.</p>

<p>The Government should speedily establish military posts from the
frontier settlements on the Missouri to the Pacific. Settlements would
speedily take place around each post, and produce in abundance would
soon be raised to supply the post and the flow of emigration.</p>

<p>An adjourned meeting of the citizens of Columbus and its vicinity
was held in the United States courtroom on the evening of Thursday,
the 10th instant, in pursuance of a resolution adopted at the last
meeting.</p>

<p>[Colonel Medary (editor of the <i>Statesman</i>), from a committee appointed
to collect facts, reported that the committee wanted more time.
The subject growing more and more interesting, on motion the committee
was allowed till next Thursday.]</p>

<p>The resolution offered at last meeting was then taken up, and on
motion of Mr. Hubbard, was amended by adding, at the end thereof,
the words "without the violation of any international law."</p>

<p>The resolution, as amended, read as follows:</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That this meeting duly appreciate the untiring labors and
distinguished abilities of Senator Linn and others in Congress, in
their successful advocacy of the just claim of the United States to the
Oregon Country; and that, as a component part of the Great West, we
hope for a speedy adjustment of our rights upon the borders of the
Pacific Ocean, and a like speedy occupation and settlement of that
country, without the violation of any international law.</p>

for the district.]</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Ohio Statesman</i> of March 10, 1843, contains the
report of the committee appointed as per the above accounts.
The report seems to have been drawn up by
Col. Samuel Medary, chairman, and is a strong and interesting
document of considerable length. It discusses
in full, with all the information available at the time,
the economic advantages of the Oregon Country, as well
as the question of title. The report is accompanied by

OREGON.</p>

<p>The Oregon fever is raging in almost every part of the Union.
Companies are forming in the East, and in several parts of Ohio, which,
added to those of Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri, will make a pretty
formidable army. The larger portion of those will probably join the
companies of Fort Independence, Missouri, and proceed together
across the mountains. It would be reasonable to suppose that there
will be at least five thousand Americans west of the Rocky Mountains
by next autumn. This, if nothing else, will compel Congress to act
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>

have a congress which will assume the responsibility even without any

are informed that the expedition to Oregon, now rendezvoused at
Westport in Jackson County, will take up its line of march on the 20th of
[May] this month. The company consists of some four or five hundred
emigrants, some with their families. They will probably have out
one hundred and fifty wagons, drawn by oxen, together with horses
for nearly every individual, and some milch cows. They will, we suppose,
take as much provision with them as they can conveniently
carry, together with a few of the necessary implements of husbandry.

From the <i>Ohio Statesman</i>, May 3, 1843.</p>

<p>We attach the suggestions in the report of General Worthington,
adopted in this city on Saturday evening, in advance of the publication
of the report:</p>

<p>"The committee, then, do most respectfully recommend that a convention
of the western and southwestern states and territories be immediately
called, to urge upon the General Government immediate
occupation of the Oregon country by a military force, and to adopt
such measures as may seem most conducive to its immediate and effectual
occupation, <i>whether the government acts or not in the matter</i>.</p>

<p>"That it be declared to the world, that the Californias never should
pass into the hands of England for any purpose whatever; and that if
they go out of the possession of Mexico, they should at once be attached
to the <i>future</i> North American Republic of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>"That all rumored negotiations of the surrender of any part of the
Pacific border for an equivalent in the Californias, should be denounced
as fraught with danger to the peace and honor and liberty of
the American continents, and as a <i>repudiation</i> of Mr. Monroe's triumphantly
sustained declaration of 1823, <i>that these continents are not to
be considered subjects of colonization by any European power</i>.</p>

<p>"That it be declared that Great Britain should be excluded from
the whole of the Northwest coast, between our boundaries with Mexico
and Russia; and, that, to give her any part, will be a virtual loss of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
the whole, as it will cripple, or entirely prevent any important commercial
operations by American citizens on our Pacific coast.</p>

<p>"That we recommend the Oregon Convention to be held in Cincinnati,
Ohio, on the third, fourth, and fifth days of July, 1843.</p>

<p>"That measures be immediately taken for the appointment of committees
at the capitals of all the states and territories west and southwest
of the Alleghanies, to urge such action upon their several legislatures
as will induce Congress to immediate occupation of Oregon
country by the arms, the laws, and the citizens of the United States.</p>

<p>"That an address be published to the people of the West, and the
Union generally, setting forth, and urging the adoption of the principles
and opinions above proclaimed."</p>

<h4>EXPERIENCES OF THE EMIGRATION OF 1843.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">From the <i>New York Tribune</i> (weekly), August 5, 1843.</p>

<p>We find the following letter from the Oregon Emigration in the
<i>Iowa Gazette</i> of the 8th instant (July):</p>

<p class="center">OREGON EMIGRATING COMPANY.</p>

<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap">Kansas River</span>, June 3, 1843.</p>

<p>* * There are over 3,000 and perhaps 5,000 head of cattle, mules,
and horses attached to the company. Captain Applegate has over 200
head, and others over 100 head. This has been a bone of contention
with some of the emigrants and very nearly divided the company.
Indeed, I am not certain but it will be the means of a split yet, as
there are a number without cattle who refuse to assist in guarding
them. The dissatisfaction is not quite so violent now, as the cattle
owners have agreed to furnish the company with beef, (in case of
scarcity of buffalo meat,) work cattle and milch cows, the former at
a price to be fixed by the committee, and the cows and oxen without
charge. The company have agreed to this proposition, and the
former law, limiting each individual to three head of loose cattle, is
thereby repealed. The number of cattle is quite too large. It is impossible
to guard them at night, and the Indians at this place have
already commenced stealing horses and killing cattle. The company
which leaves next spring for Oregon should keep strict guard on their
cattle and horses at the crossing of this river, as some eight or ten
horses and mules have been stolen in one night from our company.
Doctor Whitman from Walla Walla, who is in our company, advises
that the company divide into three or four parties, for speed and convenience,
as there will be no danger from the Indians.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span></p>

<p>[The name of the writer of the above letter is not given. The letter,
however, indicates that he came to the emigration from Burlington,
Iowa, and evidently lived there, as his letter was printed first in a
Burlington paper. He was chosen a member of the "cabinet advisers"
of the captain&mdash;nine persons. Probably these points will serve to
identify him. Was he M. M. McCarver?]</p>

<span class="smcap">Wallamette Falls</span>, April 6, 1842.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>: Your last came duly to hand and very much refreshed
our spirits. Write every opportunity, being assured that intelligence
from our friends is to us in this land like cold water to thirsty
souls. You will see by my letter where I am stationed. This is in
some respects a pleasant though laborious field of labor. This is and
is destined to be, the great emporium of the interior of this country.
Its water power for manufacturing purposes is probably not rivaled in
the States; at least, few and far between are the privileges which
equal or excel it; besides here is an excellent salmon fishery. As to
the country, taking it all and all, it is a good farming and grazing
country. The winters are so mild that the cattle and horses do well
without feeding. The country is well watered, and the inhabitants
are, in general, healthy. The ague and fever is the most prevalent
disease, although other diseases occur. On the sea coast I believe it
is more healthy than back in the country. So far as I and my family
are concerned, we have been as healthy as we ever were in the States.
Our little ones are quite as hearty and as lively as the fawns that skip
over the plains.</p>

<p>Produce of all kinds, except corn, does well here, so far as it has
been fairly tried. Some corn has been raised. Wheat, peas, and
oats, I believe, so far as quality is concerned, can not excel in any country.
Potatoes are tolerable, and in some parts excellent. Indeed, it
is my candid conviction, that an industrious and economical man can
live as well (fruit excepted) and make property as fast as in almost any
country, and far easier than in any part of the State of New York
where I have lived. Let him bring with him a few hundred dollars in
cash or property, his farming utensils, etc., and settle on one of these
delightful plains and the first year he can support his family from the
soil, as he has nothing to do but fence, plow, and sow, and prepare a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
shelter or house for his family; yet he will have to encounter some
difficulties incident to all new countries. Our mills are few and far between,
and not all of the first order, but rather multiplying and improving;
though a good millwright is very much wanted, as well as
apparatus for building mills and a great many wholesome settlers, embracing
some capitalists who will open trade with the Islands and China,
which can be done from this coast with great facility. But first of all,
our government ought to extend its jurisdiction and protection over
this country. The state of the country in this respect (especially for
Americans), as well in respect to a currency, is unpleasant. The Hudson
Bay Company seem determined to monopolize as long as possible;
yet in many respects they are quite accommodating, at least, so far as
it is to their interest. They profess to claim many of the best and most
valuable parts of the country by putting up a little hut without habitation
and forbidding any one settling in those places. They made a
claim at the Falls, on the side where I now am, about twelve years
since, hewing a quantity of timber, etc., and a few years since they put
up a small hut and covered it with bark.</p>

<p>Last fall an American took possession of a small island in the falls,
but no sooner was it known at Fort Vancouver than a company of men
was sent off with boards to put up a hut, and soon the governor of the
fort came up, greatly incensed, called the man a pilferer, and anything
but good; he, however, went on! A cooper wished to build a shop near
me, but was informed, by orders from the fort, that if he built his shop
would be torn down. He, however, went on and built; his shop still
stands. These are naked facts; and others of the same kind, if necessary,
can be forthcoming. By this you will have some clue to the state
of things in this country in this respect.</p>

<p>I have written in great haste, as this is to be off early to-morrow
morning. Besides, I have plenty of company, a number of men being
here to buy salmon, of which I have the care. Others are on their
way down the river. Indeed, my house is at times, as to travelers, more
like a public house than a Methodist preacher's.</p>

<p>Your affectionate brother,<br />

<p class="p2">A letter by Titian R. Peale to Thomas Morgan, Esq.,
of Washington, Pennsylvania:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left45"><span class="smcap">Washington, D. C.</span>, February 6, 1843.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: Observing the interest you have taken in the "Oregon
Bill," now before Congress, I conclude that a few notes, coming from
one who has recently traveled through a portion of the Oregon territory,
will be acceptable to you, and probably be of use to some of your
neighbors, who may feel disposed to profit by the inducements offered,
should the bill pass and become a law.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p>Being a member of the Scientific Corps of the United States Expedition,
in 1841, I had the misfortune to be wrecked, in the ship Peacock,
at the mouth of the Columbia River, and subsequently traveled that
portion of the country south of the Columbia River, known as the Wallamette
Valley, and thence across the mountains to California.</p>

<p>The soil, we observed, generally on that route, although not as rich
as that of the Mississippi Valley, was still sufficiently so, when cultivated,
to produce from twenty to forty bushels of wheat to the acre,
of as good quality as any I have ever seen in my native State (Pennsylvania),
which, added to the facilities for settlers in finding the land
ready for the plough, without the labor of clearing, while sufficiency
of the finest timber is found on the banks of the numerous streams, is
alone sufficient to invite to the further settlement of the country when
known. But this is not all. The winters are so mild that it has never
yet been found necessary to house cattle, or provide winter food for
them. They thrive and multiply beyond expectation.</p>

<p>Salmon are procured in great profusion in almost all the streams,
and ready markets are found for them, as well as all the other products
of the territory, in the markets of Mexico, South America, and the
numerous islands of the Pacific Ocean. Thus, from its position in the
Pacific, it has all the advantages which we possess in the Atlantic
Ocean; gaining in the China what might be considered as partly lost
from the European trade.</p>

<p>The tract of country to which I have more particularly alluded is
about two hundred and fifty miles long, including the mouth of the
Columbia River, and reaching to about one hundred and fifty miles
from the coast. This tract of country I considered quite equal, if not
superior to Pennsylvania, both in commercial position and capability
in agricultural product, and much superior in its advantages for raising
cattle, etc., being generally interspersed with prairie and woodland.</p>

<p>Would the above hasty notes prove satisfactory to you or any of
your friends, or if they only serve to awaken a spirit of inquiry, it will
always be a source of pleasure to me in having communicated them.</p>

<p>With great respect, I have the honor to remain, yours truly,</p>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">Fort Vancouver</span>, November 10, 1843.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Penn</span>: I reached here on yesterday, and the grass is now
as luxuriant as a wheat field. Provisions are abundant here, and Doctor
McLoughlin (who is the most liberal and hospitable man in the world,)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
furnishes the emigrants with wheat to be paid for in cash or in wheat
next year. At the Cascades we met provisions sent us by the Doctor,
and all purchased who applied, even without money. Two boats have
been sent us with provisions, and the Doctor has lent two boats to the
emigrants free of charge. We find him doing everything to aid the
emigrants; and those who are here in the Wallamette Valley, are as
hospitable as they could possibly afford to be. Business is very brisk,
and labor finds ready employment and prompt payment at high prices.
Necessaries of all kinds can be procured at Vancouver.</p>

<p>Most of the emigrants have reached here with their cattle and baggage,
and will soon have their wagons here also. We find that cattle
bear a fine price here and will sell readily. Cows at from $50 to $75,
oxen at from $50 to $100 per yoke; labor $1 per day; beef from 5 to 6
cents; salt salmon $9 to $10 per barrel of about 300 pounds; wheat $1;
flour $4 per 100 pounds. Anything can be sold here. Butter from 25
to 37½ cents; sugar, tea, coffee, and dry goods&mdash;plenty. American
horses bear better prices than they do in the States.</p>

<p>The country exceeds my expectations, and certainly if man can not
supply all his wants here he can not anywhere. Lieutenant Fremont,
who bears this, can give you further information. I must close as he
leaves immediately.</p>

<p>Letter of Peter H. Burnett's, taken from the <i>Ohio
Statesman</i> of October 23, 1844, which quotes it from the
<i>Globe</i>, Washington:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">Linnton</span>, Oregon, July 25, 1844.</p>

<p>I am here in our new town, which we have named as above, in respect
for Doctor Linn's services for this territory. Gen. M. McCalla
[M. M. McCarver] and myself have laid out the town together. He is a
gentleman from Iowa Territory, and laid out Burlington, the seat of
government. He is an enterprising man. Our place is ten miles from
Vancouver, on the west bank of the Wallamette River, at the head of
navigation, and three or four miles above the mouth of the Wallamette,
and twenty-five miles below the Wallamette Falls. I have no doubt
but that this place will be the great commercial town in the territory.
We are selling lots at $50 each, and sell them fast at that. At the
falls there is quite a town already. I own two lots in Oregon City (the
town at the falls). They are said to be worth $200 each. I got them of
Doctor McLoughlin for two lots here in Linnton. I was six weeks at
Vancouver, where myself and family were most hospitably entertained
by Doctor McLoughlin, free of charge. He has been a great friend
to me, and has done much for this emigration generally. I find provisions
high&mdash;pork 10 cents, potatoes 40 cents, flour $4 per hundred.</p>

<p>But I find it costs me a little, even less to live here than at Weston.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
I paid for wood the last year I lived at Weston $75, for corn and fodder
$50, all of which is saved here. We use much less pork here than
in Missouri. The salmon are running now and will continue to run
until October next. They generally commence running the last of
February and end in October. I have had several messes of fresh
salmon. At this point we purchase of the Indians ducks, geese, swans,
salmon, potatoes, feathers, and venison, for little or nothing. Ducks,
four loads; geese, eight loads; swans, ten loads; salmon, four loads of
powder and shot each. Feathers cost about twelve and a half cents a
pound. There are more ducks, etc., here than you ever saw; also
pheasants in great numbers. They remain here all the winter. I
have hunted very little, being too busy. We find it very profitable to
get of the Indians, to whom we trade old shirts, pantaloons, vests, and all
sorts of clothing. They are more anxious to purchase clothes than
any people you ever saw. You can sell anything here that was ever sold.
Stocking Cary ploughs $5 each. We have an excellent blacksmith living
in our place who makes first rate Cary ploughs at thirty-one and
a quarter cents a pound, he finding it. [Omitting an elaborate description
of the Willamette Valley.] American cows are worth here from
$50 to $75; American horses from $50 to $75; oxen from $75 to $125 per
yoke. This is the finest country for grazing cattle you ever saw. They
keep fat all winter. Butter sells at 20 to 25 cents. And, what I did
not expect to find, this is a good country for hogs. At all events you
have here plenty of grass, a root they call wappato, and also plenty of
white oak mast. A first rate market can be had for any and everything,
and you have never seen business more brisk. Times are first
rate and everybody is busy. The manufacturing power is unsurpassed in
the world. There are more fine sites than you ever saw. Such water
power as that at the falls of Platte can be found everywhere. * *</p>

<p>[Omitting a portion of the letter describing the timber of Oregon.]
I will not persuade you, nor will I any of my friends, to come to this
country; but were I in the States again, I should come myself. For
$300 you could purchase one hundred young heifers; and in driving
them here you might lose from five to ten. When you reached here
they would be worth $4,000, and in ten years, without labor or expense,
would make you a splendid fortune. You can move here with less
expense than you could to Tennessee or Kentucky. Your provisions,
teams, etc., you have; your oxen and horses, especially your fine
American mares, would be worth double as much as they would cost
you there. There are very few good American horses here. The Indian
horses are not so gentle as the American, nor so fine blooded.
The American cattle are greatly superior to the Spanish for milk, as
they give more milk and are more gentle; but the Spanish cattle are
larger. Cows have calves here from fifteen to twenty months old, and
sheep have lambs twice a year in some parts of territory. The reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
is they are always fat and get their growth much sooner. It is my deliberate
opinion that no country in the world affords so fair an opportunity
to acquire a living as this. I can see no objection to it, except it
be by a man who loves liquor, for he can get none here.</p>

From the <i>Ohio Statesman</i>, October 23, 1844. Quoted by the <i>Statesman</i> from the
<i>St. Louis Reporter</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>We make the following extracts from two letters which
were published in the <i>Western Pioneer</i> of the 6th instant,
written by William L. Smith and John Holman, two emigrants
to Oregon. The information from that territory,
received this year, is of the most interesting character:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The prospect is quite good for a young man to make a fortune in
this country, as all kinds of produce are high, and likely to remain so
from the extensive demand. The Russian settlements in Asia; the
Sandwich Islands; a great portion of California, and the whaling vessels
of the Northwest coast, procure their supplies from this place.</p>

<p>There is as yet but little money in the country, and the whole trade
is carried on by orders on an agent or factor. For instance, when I
sell my crop of wheat, the purchaser asks me where I wish to receive
the pay. Vancouver is as yet the principal point, and an order on
that point enables the seller to procure goods, or cattle, or anything
else for it.</p>

<p>The population of this country consists of French, sailors, mountain
traders, missionaries, and emigrants from the States. The French
population consists of old worn-out servants of the Hudson Bay Company;
they universally have Indian wives, and many children, some of
whom are very handsome; this part of the population are Catholics.
The sailors are those who deserted from vessels while lying on the coast,
and have also intermarried with the Indians, and but few of them have
embraced any religion&mdash;they are, however, generally good citizens.
The mountain traders are similar to the sailors, except that they have
nearly all embraced the Methodist or Catholic religion.</p>

<p>The citizens held a meeting some time since and unanimously adopted
the statutes of Iowa Territory for their code of laws until the government
of the United States should make laws for them. There is little or
no crime in Oregon as yet, which is attributed to the absence of spirituous
liquors&mdash;and so sensible are the citizens of this fact that they are
unanimous in favor of excluding it. In fact, Doctor McLoughlin has
several cargoes in his warehouse now, which he bought in preference
to allowing it to be sold in the country. I can not speak too highly of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
this excellent man for his kindness to us all. He sent several boats
loaded with provisions to meet the emigrants last fall, and continued
to distribute little luxuries among us as long as we remained in reach
of him&mdash;he is always on the lookout for an opportunity to bestow his
charity, and bestows with no sparing hand. His intention is to quit
the Hudson Bay Company and become an American citizen.</p>

<p>Our prairies are beautiful, soil good, and the best stock range I ever
saw. I have located and recorded six sections of land, which I can
hold for one year by making certain improvements thereon, which I
intend doing. I can stand in my door and see over all of them. Everything
is plenty, but sells high. The prospects for industrious young
men are truly flattering. I do think the six sections we have now in
possession are intrinsically worth $20,000; that would be $5 per acre,
and that is not near the value, taking everything into consideration.
The situation for trade and commerce is certainly better than any other
country. The climate, soil, timber, water, health, products of the country,
and the prospects for good society combine to make it delightful.
It would astonish you to see the state of society here&mdash;more hospitality
and friendship, more morality, industry, and I do believe religion, than
you will see anywhere. There are a good many scattering Indians, but
nothing to be feared from them.</p>

From the <i>National Intelligencer</i>, October 28, 1843.</p>

<p class="center">EMIGRATION&mdash;THE FAR WEST.</p>

<p>We presume most persons thought that when the tide of emigration
reached Oregon it would go no farther, for it did not seem that the
"Far West" could get beyond the Pacific. We find, however, that
some of the emigrants who have reached Oregon are "dissatisfied with
the country, and contemplate going to California this spring." So
says a letter in the <i>Iowa Herald</i> from one of the settlers, who for his
own part likes the country very well, and expects to end his days there.
He describes the Oregon region as rough and broken, generally heavy
timbered, principally with fir, yellow pine, cedar, hemlock, oak, ash,
and maple&mdash;well watered, with about one tenth prairie of excellent
quality. In the streams is an abundance of fish, among which are the
finest salmon in the world. Oregon City is a thriving little place, and
from its advantageous position it is likely to become a thriving great
one. It is situated at the head of navigation on the Oregon or Columbia
River, and at the foot of Walhammat Falls, one of the greatest
water powers in the world.</p>

<h3>HISTORY OF THE PREPARATION OF
THE FIRST CODE OF OREGON.</h3>

<p>I am requested by the Oregon Bar Association to write
a paper on "The Preparation and Adoption of the First
Code."</p>

<p>Before writing about the actual preparation of the first
code, I desire to say something about the confused and
uncertain condition of statutory law in Oregon Territory,
prior to 1853, and the reasons which induced the territorial
legislature of 1852-53 to elect three commissioners
to prepare a code of laws for Oregon Territory.</p>

<p>On June 27, 1844, the Provisional Government of Oregon,
declared that "All the statute laws of Iowa Territory,
passed at the first session of the legislative assembly
of said territory, and not of a local character, and not
incompatible with the conditions and circumstances of
this country, shall be the law of this government, unless
otherwise modified": Laws, 1843-49, p. 100.</p>

<p>The fourteenth section of the act of Congress of August
14, 1848, organizing the Territory of Oregon, continued
these laws of the Provisional Government in force until
they should be altered or repealed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<p>At the first session of the legislative assembly, held at
Oregon City, two acts were passed by that body, which,
owing to the construction placed upon them by the
supreme court of the Territory, had a tendency to produce
dissension and discord among the people of Oregon,
which lasted for two or three years. One of these was
"An act to provide for the selection of places for location
and erection of the public buildings of the Territory of
Oregon," passed February 1, 1851.</p>

<p>The other act was one which declared to be adopted,
and in force, certain acts of the revised statutes of Iowa
Territory published in 1843. The legislative assembly
of Oregon by a single act adopted these acts of Iowa,
designating them by their several titles, and the dates of
their passage. This law was generally known as the
"Chapman Code," owing to the fact that the bill was
introduced by and its passage secured through the influence
of Hon. W. W. Chapman, then a member of the
legislative assembly.</p>

<p>Soon after these two acts were passed, their validity
was questioned, especially that of the one which located
the public buildings, and transferred the seat of government
from Oregon City to Salem. Those who denied
their validity did so on the ground that they contravened
that clause of the organic act of August 14, 1848, section
6, which provides that "To avoid improper influences
which may result from intermixing in one act such things
as have no proper relation to each other; every act shall
embrace but one object, and that shall be expressed in
the title."</p>

<p>Legal proceedings were soon taken by persons interested
in retaining the capital at Oregon City to declare
the act of removal invalid. A suit brought for that purpose
came on for hearing before the supreme court at
Oregon City, in December, 1851. By law the judges of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
the district courts composed the supreme court of the
territory. They were Thomas Nelson, Chief Justice,
O. C. Pratt, and William Strong. Of these Nelson and
Strong had been appointed by Presidents Fillmore and
Taylor, respectively, while Pratt was holding over under
an appointment of President Polk. The former were
Whigs politically, while the latter was a Democrat.
Judges Nelson and Strong convened at Oregon City, and
opened the supreme court there. Judge Pratt went to
Salem under the act which changed the seat of government,
but without a quorum could not hold a session of
the court. Judges Nelson and Strong then decided that
the act of the legislative assembly providing for the
selection of places for the location and erection of the
public buildings, passed February 1, 1851, was void, because
it contravened the organic law of August 14, 1848,
as before stated. The opinions of the judges were never
published in the Oregon Reports, for what reason I do
not know. Possibly they were not filed with the supreme
court. Judge Pratt claimed that this decision amounted
to nothing because it was not made at the seat of government,
as established by act of the legislative assembly,
and in this opinion that body then assembled at Salem,
readily concurred. This heated controversy about the
location of the capital was, however, settled by a joint
resolution of Congress, adopted May 4, 1852 (10 U. S.
Statutes, 146). The first section legalized the act of the
territorial legislature which located the public buildings,
and the second section declared that the late session of
the legislative assembly was held in conformity with the
provisions of law. This, of course, ended all dispute
about the location of the capital, but unhappily another
controversy grew out of the construction placed by Judges
Nelson and Strong upon the sixth section of the organic
law of August 14, 1848. For the same reasons which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
they held the act for the location of the public buildings
void, they also held the act of the legislative assembly,
which adopted the revised statutes of Iowa, to be also
invalid. In other words, these judges held that by
adopting several distinct statutes of Iowa in one act, it
necessarily embraced more than one object. Judge Pratt
took a different view and held that the act of the legislative
assembly embraced but one object, to wit, the adoption
of a code of laws of the territory.</p>

<p>The result of these conflicting views of the judges was
that in Judge Nelson's judicial district, composed of
Clackamas, Marion, and Linn counties, and in Judge
Strong's district, composed of Clatsop County and the
counties north of the Columbia River, the Iowa Code of
1838, adopted by the Provisional Government, was held
to be in force. Judge Pratt's district, composed of all
the territory west of the Willamette River, included the
counties of Washington, Yamhill, Polk, and Benton, and
in this district the "Chapman Code" of the Revised Code
of Iowa Statutes of 1843, was recognized as the law in
force. In the district of Nelson and Strong, the lawyers
would cite the law from the "Little Blue Book," as the
volume of Statutes of Iowa of 1838 was called. In Judge
Pratt's district the same lawyers would quote from the
"Big Blue Book," as the Iowa Code of 1843 was called.
There were but three or four copies of the <i>little blue book</i>
in the territory, one of which was owned by Hon. A. E.
Wait. The last time I saw it it was in the possession of
Hon. Benton Killin. There were only two copies of the
<i>big blue book</i> in Oregon and the statutes adopted by the
Chapman Code were not published until the latter part
of 1853, when they were printed by the territorial printer
and bound in paper covers. A number of these printed
copies were distributed among the several counties in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
territory, but the uncertainty and doubt as to their validity
made them of little value.</p>

<p>As I said before, Judge Pratt's views of this legal controversy
coincided with those of the legislative assembly,
then in session at Salem, and that body passed an
act detaching the counties of Marion and Linn from the
judicial district of Judge Nelson, leaving him only Clackamas
County, in which he resided. In this act it was
provided that the terms of court in Marion and Linn
counties should commence one week earlier than they did
under the old law. So Judge Pratt held court at Salem
and Albany under the new law, and a week later in each
county Judge Nelson went to Salem and Albany to hold
the district court under the old law. He found, however,
that Judge Pratt had preceded him, held the courts, and
adjourned for the term. Judge Nelson finding that no
business was prepared for hearing before him by the
lawyers, and no jury summoned to try cases, returned
somewhat disgusted to Oregon City, and was soon after
relieved by the appointment of Hon. George H. Williams,
as chief justice of the territory. He went back to his
home in New York, where I believe he still lives [1894.]</p>

<p>I have referred to this almost forgotten history of the
early days of the territorial government of Oregon to
show the necessity that existed for a revision of the statutory
laws of the territory. The uncertainty as to what
laws were then in force, and the desire to be relieved
from this condition of affairs was the principal reason
which induced the legislative assembly to pass the act of
January, 1853, providing for the election by that body of
three commissioners to prepare a draft for a code of
laws, to be submitted to the next legislature. In pursuance
of this act, the legislative assembly elected the
following commissioners in the order named: James K.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Kelly, of Clackamas County, Reuben P. Boise, of Polk
County, and Daniel R. Bigelow, of Thurston County.</p>

<p>Being first elected, I acted as chairman of the board,
and notified the other commissioners of the time of our
first meeting, which took place some time in March, 1853.
We met in the council chamber of the legislative building,
where all our subsequent meetings were held.</p>

<p>The first two or three days were occupied in discussing
the general outline of our duties and the kind of code to
be prepared. By common consent we agreed to accept
the New York code of practice as the basis of our own,
but with a notable exception in regard to proceedings in
equity. Mr. Bigelow strongly insisted upon having no
separate court of equity or of equity proceedings, but
urged that we should follow the example of California in
this respect. Mr. Boise and I differed from Mr. Bigelow.
We contended that in the organic act of August 14, 1848,
a separate system of equity proceedings was contemplated,
wherein it is provided that "each district court
or judge thereof shall appoint its clerk, <i>who shall be the
register in chancery</i>": Act, August 14, 1848, § 9.</p>

<p>That it was so understood by the members of the first
legislative assembly appears by the act of September 14,
1849, directing the mode of proceedings in chancery:
See Hamilton Laws.</p>

<p>The system of equity jurisprudence and proceedings
in equity adopted by the first code commissioners has
now prevailed in Oregon for forty years, and during all
that time I think has met the approbation of both bench
and the bar.</p>

<p>Another thing agreed upon by the commissioners was
that the code should be prepared so that it might be
adopted by the legislative assembly in several acts instead
of one, as was done in the Chapman Code in 1850. This
was done in order to comply with the provisions of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
organic law, which required that every act should embrace
but one object.</p>

<p>These preliminaries being settled it was agreed that
each commissioner should take one subject and prepare
the draft for an act upon that particular branch of the
law. During the preparation of these drafts the commissioners
held frequent consultations, as often as once
or twice a week, to discuss and agree upon the proper
phraseology to be adopted, or arrangement of subject-matter
in the proposed act.</p>

<p>It was agreed among us that Mr. Boise should prepare
the act relating to executors and administrators, and also
proceedings in the probate courts.</p>

<p>To Mr. Bigelow was assigned the duty of preparing the
act relating to crimes and misdemeanors, and to regulate
criminal proceedings. I undertook to prepare the code
of civil procedure in actions at law and suits in equity.</p>

<p>These three subjects embraced the greater part of the
laws which we undertook to prepare, and, after their
completion, the remaining portion of our work was comparatively
easy and brief. According to my recollection
it was completed in the latter part of the summer or
early fall of 1853. We prepared the draft for an entirely
new code of statutory laws, with the single exception of
the law relating to wills. This had been enacted by the
legislative assembly in 1849, at its first session, the main
features of it being a transcript from the Missouri statute
on the same subject. As this was one of the first acts
passed by our own legislation we adopted it in our draft
with only a few verbal changes.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1853 Joseph G. Wilson, afterwards
Judge Wilson of the supreme court, came to Oregon,
and about May we employed him as our clerk to transcribe
the drafts prepared by us, in order that they could
be printed for the use of the legislative assembly at its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
next session in December. We caused about two hundred
copies to be printed by Mr. Asahel Bush, the territorial
printer, for that purpose. These were published
in an unbound octavo volume, so that they could be
readily separated into different bills for legislative use.</p>

<p>Soon after we entered upon the discharge of our duties
as commissioners many of our political friends suggested
the propriety of electing one or all of us members of the
next legislative assembly, so that we could explain to the
members or give any desired information to them concerning
our work. We soon, however, learned that Congress
had passed the act to organize the Territory of Washington,
and this would necessarily prevent Mr. Bigelow from
becoming a member of the Oregon legislative assembly.</p>

<p>Mr. Boise was nominated by the Democratic party as
a candidate for member of the House of Representatives
from Polk County. I was nominated by the same party
as member of the Council, to fill a vacancy caused by the
resignation of Hon. A. L. Lovejoy, who had recently been
appointed Postal Agent for Oregon by President Pierce.
Both Mr. Boise and myself were elected on the first Monday
in June, 1853.</p>

<p>The legislative assembly met on the first Monday in
December, and after the respective houses were organized
Mr. Boise was appointed chairman of the Judiciary Committee
in the lower house, while I was appointed chairman
of the same committee in the upper branch of the
legislature. Of course, the burden of seeing the code
properly passed rested with him and myself. We divided
the draft which the code commissioners had prepared into
proper bills, according to the subject-matter of each.
Some of these bills were introduced into the House of
Representatives by Mr. Boise, and others of them into
the Council by myself. All we had to do was simply to
preface an enacting clause to the bill as it had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
printed by order of the commissioners, and to insert a
section at the end of each bill declaring that the act should
be in force from and after the first of May next. The
reason these acts were made to take effect on May 1, 1854,
was that there was no possibility of having them printed
before that time. Indeed, there were no facilities then
existing in Oregon for either printing or binding the
volume containing the statutes comprised in the first
code. Mr. Bush, the territorial printer, made arrangements
to have them printed and bound in New York. I
do not now remember how many copies of the code were
ordered to be printed, but certainly several hundred.
About two hundred of these were sent to Oregon by way
of Panama and arrived safely some time in the summer
of 1854. The remaining copies of that edition were sent
around Cape Horn by a sailing vessel. These never
reached Oregon. They were either shipwrecked or so
injured that they were worthless. At the next session of
the legislative assembly, commencing in December, 1854,
that body ordered a new edition to be printed to supply
the place of the copies which were lost at sea, and that
edition was printed in New York in 1855. It included the
acts which were passed at that session with those of the
code adopted at the preceding session of the legislature.
This accounts for the printing of two editions&mdash;one in
1854 and another in 1855.</p>

<p>Between May 1, 1854, when the code took effect and
the arrival of the first copies of the printed volume from
New York, we were somewhat troubled for want of evidence
of existing statutes, and the judges and lawyers
used in the courts copies of the printed draft reported by
the code commissioners. A few of these unbound volumes
still remained and such changes as had been made by the
legislature were noted in them. Some of the lawyers
even went to the trouble of having them indexed so as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
be more convenient for reference and citation. When,
however, the first copies of the code arrived from New
York these unbound copies of the code commissioners'
draft were thrown aside. One of them I kept as a time-honored
curiosity for many years.</p>

<p>Although the <i>Oregon Code</i>, as it was then termed, has
since been revised two or three times to adapt it to a state,
instead of a territorial government, yet in its main features
it has remained substantially the same as when prepared
by the first code commissioners and adopted by the
legislative assembly of 1853-54.</p>

<p>The commissioners who prepared the first code of Oregon
are all still living [1894], but nearly all the members
of the legislature that adopted it are gone. Besides Judge
Boise and myself I can think of no one of them who is
now living.</p>

<h3>A PIONEER RAILROAD BUILDER.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p>Responding to a request for an account of the operations
of Dr. D. S. Baker as a promoter and financier of
transportation enterprises, and particularly of the Walla
Walla and Columbia River Railway, I herewith submit
some scraps of history.</p>

<p>Dr. Dorsey S. Baker was born in Wabash County, Illinois,
October 18, 1823. He studied the profession of
medicine at the Philadelphia Medical College. Crossed
the Plains to Oregon with the emigration of 1848, and
went to California in 1849. The practice of his profession
was remunerative, but his strong predilection for business
led him to abandon a profession always distasteful.</p>

<p>He engaged in the hardware business in Portland in
the early fifties, and subsequently built a flouring mill
at Oakland, in Southern Oregon, and it was his boast
that he brought to Oregon the first pair of mill stones
ever used in the State. In 1861 he removed to Walla
Walla, then a trading post adjacent to the army garrison
established some years previously. He engaged in
the mercantile business, being associated with William
Stephens. The firm name was D. S. Baker &amp; Co., afterward
changed to Baker &amp; Boyer, when his brother-in-law,
John F. Boyer, was taken into the firm. The firm did
a large business with the stockmen and settlers, and in
outfitting miners and packers flocking by thousands to
the Oro Fino and Florence mines, and later to Boisé,
Idaho, and Montana. Sales were large and profits good,
and the firm of Baker &amp; Boyer flourished.</p>

<p>Doctor Baker was a man of keen business judgment
and great foresight. It is probably not an over statement
to say that the State of Washington has not numbered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
among her citizens any that approached him in financial
ability. In 1862 he became associated with the late
Senator Corbett and Captain Ankeny in the steamboat
business. They built the steamer Spray, which plied
between Celilo and Lewiston. The company had boats
on what was known as the Middle River, between The
Dalles and the Cascades, and also on the Lower River
between the Cascades and Portland. They built a wooden
tramway portage on the Washington side at the cascades,
using mules as motive power. The remains of this tramway
could be seen from the opposite shore within recent
years. This company's line was run in opposition to
that of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, to which
it finally sold.</p>

<p>The portage of the cascades, being the key to the situation,
was the bone of contention. The Oregon Steam
Navigation Company had procured the passage of a bill
through Congress giving them what they claimed to be
an exclusive right of way over the cascade portage, and
this question not having been at that time adjudicated,
Doctor Baker's company sold out as above recited.</p>

<p>Doctor Baker's next transportation enterprise was the
building of a narrow gauge railroad from Walla Walla
to Wallula. He organized a company under the corporate
name of the Walla Walla and Columbia River Railroad
Company in 1871. Among the original stockholders
were Doctor Baker, John F. Boyer, Paine Brothers &amp;
Moore, B. L. Sharpstein, Charles Moore, B. F. Stone,
William Stephens, William O. Green&mdash;all residents of
Walla Walla. Doctor Baker was, however, the capitalist,
and it was his money, his energy and unflagging perseverance
that carried the enterprise to a successful consummation.
To build thirty miles of railroad under
conditions then existing was a great undertaking. Ties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
and timber for bridges had to be obtained from the head
waters of the Yakima River, an untried stream.</p>

<p>A logging camp was established in the winter of 1872&mdash;a
Wisconsin lumberman named Tarbox being placed in
charge. An attempt was made to drive logs to the mouth
of the Yakima the following spring, but the water proved
insufficient and the log drive was hung up. Another
expedition was sent to the woods the following winter, in
charge of D. W. Small, afterward a well known resident
and business man of Walla Walla. He succeeded, by
incredible effort, in bringing out the logs. A mill was
erected on the banks or east bank of the Columbia above
the old town of Wallula, where the ties were sawed, and it
was at this point that the first railroad construction in
Washington, other than the portage road of the cascades,
was begun. Two small dummy or camel-back engines
were bought in Pennsylvania and shipped out via San
Francisco and Portland. Freight on them from Portland
to Wallula was about $450 each. The first ten miles of the
road was built with wooden stringers six by six, laid on
cross ties. It was Doctor Baker's belief that these ties
would last for a few years, and it was his intention to then
replace them with T rails, but in this he was doomed to
disappointment. When construction had reached the ten-mile
post, the wooden rails at the river end were worn
out. He then bought ten miles of strap iron and continued
construction. This also proved a failure. Finally,
convinced in the rough school of actual experience that
T rail only would serve his purpose, he ordered, through
Allen &amp; Lewis of Portland, twenty miles of 26-pound rail.
This was purchased in Wales and was brought around
the Horn in a clipper ship coming to the Columbia River
for a cargo of wheat. From Portland the rail was shipped
by the Oregon Steam Navigation Company line to Wallula.
This involved five handlings&mdash;two at the cascade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
portage, two at The Dalles, and one at Wallula. The
cost of the rails and the freight were both very great.
When the road reached a point ten miles out from the
Columbia it began to haul wheat, the teamsters being
glad to avoid the long, hard pull over the sandy roads.</p>

<p>When the road had reached Whitman Station, six miles
west of Walla Walla, Doctor Baker's available funds were
exhausted, and he would not borrow. He thereupon
announced that its terminus would remain there until
the earnings sufficed to complete it to Walla Walla. The
citizens, fearing a rival town would spring up at Whitman,
promptly raised and donated $25,000 to secure the
continuance of the road to Walla Walla.</p>

<p>In the inception of the enterprise, Doctor Baker had
asked Walla Walla County, through the board of county
commissioners, to guarantee the interest on a proposed
issue of bonds, to be sold to provide funds for the construction
of the road, offering in return to permit the
commissioners to fix the rate for carrying grain to the
Columbia, provided only the rate should not be less than
$3 per ton. The question was submitted to a vote, and
rejected by a decided majority. Doctor Baker then said:
"I will build the road without your assistance, and you
must allow me to fix the rate." The rate was $5 per
ton from Walla Walla to the river. There was an additional
charge of fifty cents for transfer to the steamboat.
The Oregon Steam Navigation Company's charge was $6
per ton, and there was a wharfage charge at Portland of 50
cents, making a total of $12 per ton, or thirty-six cents per
bushel from Walla Walla to Portland. The charge of $5
per ton seems now a pretty stiff rate, but teamsters in
those days sometimes charged $12 per ton for the same
haul, although the usual charge was $6. They could not
always handle the crop, and the price fluctuated.</p>

<p>During the discouraging period of construction few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
people believed Doctor Baker would ever complete the
road. His friends thought he would fail utterly, and
predicted that his fortune would be lost, but the Doctor
knew better than most the wealth of the country's undeveloped
resources, and with a faith that nothing could
shake, and with a determination that grew stronger as
each obstacle presented itself, continued the work of construction,
staking his last dollar on the success of his
enterprise. No mortgage was ever placed on the property
during his ownership, and no lien or debt encumbered
it. It paid unheard of dividends, and was sold at
a price greatly exceeding its cost. The Oregon Steam
Navigation Company bought six-sevenths of the stock in
1877, Doctor Baker remaining as president. During this
ownership a branch line was built from Whitman to a
point known as Blue Mountain Station, in Umatilla
County, Oregon, to tap the wheat fields of that county.</p>

<p>Still later, on the first day of July, 1879, the road was
included in a sale made by the Oregon Steam Navigation
Company to Henry Villard. The track was changed to
a standard gauge, and became a part of the present Oregon
Railway and Navigation system.</p>

<p>Many amusing stories are told of experiences in traveling
over this line, known as Doctor Baker's "rawhide
road." Wheat was hauled on flat cars. A box car, with
seats along the sides, originally did duty as a passenger
coach. To the traveling public this was known as "the
hearse," but no serious accident ever occurred on the
line. It was strictly a daylight road, Doctor Baker persistently
refusing to allow trains to be run at night.</p>

<p>H. W. Fairweather, who took charge of the road after
its purchase by the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company,
still tells of some of his early experiences. At that
time the law required a printed schedule of freight rates
to be posted in each car. Looking about in vain, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
finally found the required notice posted in the roof of the
car in such a position that to read it the reader must
lie on his back. The newspapers have another story regarding
General Sherman's ride over this road. In 1877
the General had ridden through Montana and Idaho, examining
the country with reference to the proper location
of military posts, and had reached Walla Walla on his
way to the coast. He is said to have made application
for a special train to take him to Wallula, which Doctor
Baker refused to furnish, remarking that there was a
train load of wheat going out during the afternoon, upon
which the General could take passage, and that availing
himself of the opportunity, this aggregation of military
glory bestrode a sack of wheat, and thus mounted, was
dispatched on his journey. The fact was that he rode in
a passenger coach attached to the freight train, but perhaps
it is hardly worth while to spoil so good a story.</p>

<p>Some years after the sale of the Walla Walla and Columbia
River line, Doctor Baker built another narrow
gauge to connect with a timber flume bringing lumber
and wood to Walla Walla. This line was fifteen miles
in length and extended to the town of Dixie in the foot
hills of the Blue Mountains. It did a considerable business
in transporting wheat. This was also sold to the
Oregon Railway and Navigation Company, which company
still operates it as a narrow gauge.</p>

<p>This was Doctor Baker's last undertaking, his health
having failed soon after the completion of this road.</p>

<p>When Henry Villiard first met Doctor Baker, he said
to him: "You were a bold man to build into the lion's
jaws," refering to the fact that the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company controlled the outlet down the Columbia,
but Doctor Baker had formulated a maxim, "He
who owns the approaches to the river owns the river,"
by which he meant that the business of the boats originated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
on the railroad and the boats were dependent on
the railroad.</p>

<p>One of Doctor Baker's biographers has said of him,
"He was the self-reliant architect of his own fortune."
Perhaps no man in the Northwest has left his name more
completely entwined into the history of his chosen country
and city than has Dorsey S. Baker, who cast his lot
with Walla Walla forty years ago, whose fortunes were
the fortunes of the town and whose successes were the
successes of the place he called his "home."</p>

<p>He died at Walla Walla July 5, 1888. An imposing
granite monument, in the City Cemetery, emblematic of
his rugged virtues and strength of character, marks his
last resting place.</p>

<h3>FROM WALLA WALLA TO SAN
FRANCISCO.</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Capt. John Mullan, U. S. A.</span></p>

<p class="center">From the Washington <i>Statesman</i> (Walla Walla) of November 29
and December 6, 1862.</p>

<p>For those who have not made the journey direct from
Walla Walla, through the agricultural heart of Oregon,
and across the mountains through the mining region of
northern California, there is much of interest and pleasure;
and though the trip should be fraught with much
personal discomfort, there is much to repay the traveler
in the collection of statistics, and in seeing a region
where the wilderness of yesterday has to-day given place
to homes, where material prosperity, at least, arrest the
attention of the traveler at every mile of the journey.
The mode of conveyance from Walla Walla to Wallula is
by stages that run daily between these points, and where
the journey is of six hours and a cost of $5 brings you to
the banks of the Columbia, whence you take steamers for
the Des Chutes Landing. The improvements along the
banks of the Walla Walla, in the shape of new and additional
enclosures for farming purposes, during the last
two years, have been many, and mark with unerring certainty
the future of the Walla Walla country, as the distributing
center for a radius of three hundred miles of
country, now fast developing in all the elements of material,
social, and political prosperity. It has more than
once occurred to me that the Walla Walla River, by a
system of locks, could be advantageously used as a line
of connection between Wallula and Walla Walla, and one
needs but see the long line of wagons and pack trains,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
heavily freighted for the interior, to become convinced
that either this or some more rapid and economical means
is positively demanded, in order to connect the heart of
the valley with the Columbia River. Economy at the
present would argue in favor of converting the river into
a canal, but the prospective wants of the country are
much more in favor of a railroad connection. For a distance
of eighteen miles below Walla Walla the nature of
the face of the country is eminently suited in its present
condition for laying a railroad track; and thence to Wallula
the character of work being either excavation in
sand, clay, or soft rock, will enable a road to be built at
economical figures. The Touchet and the crossings of
the Walla Walla River will require heavy bridges but
good abutment sites are to be had, and the streams not
being subject to overflow, no impediment will ever be had
from this cause. It could be safely stated that a capital
of $600,000 would construct and equip this road, and
when it is known that not less than one hundred thousand
tons of freight, at $20 per ton, and ten thousand passengers,
at $5 each, pass over this line annually, it does
seem strange that capitalists are not disposed to move in
the matter in a practical shape. It is a project in which
every citizen could become interested. The farmers could
supply all the ties needed; the mills are fully capacitated
to supply all the lumber demanded, and the surplus population
from the mines and those out of employment
could advantageously supply all the labor needed in its
construction; and with the valley of Walla Walla to supply
every necessary of life, to me it is anything but an
Utopian idea, and I feel warranted in believing that
another twelve months will not roll around before the
matter is taken up with a view to its practical execution.
The teams now freighting on the road will not necessarily
be thrown out of employment, but the increasing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
development of the interior will cause them simply to
seek new lines upon which to transport this same freight
after the railroad shall have deposited it at the city of
Walla Walla, which nature has constituted a commercial
center, and from which will be distributed to every point
of the compass the merchandise which their wants demand.</p>

<p>Reaching the Columbia at Wallula one is pleased with
the commercial character which this point is fast assuming.
Freight strewn along the levee for half a mile&mdash;stores
erected, commission houses plying their vocations,
and everything giving an earnest of a prosperous
future. This site has doubtless many advantages as a
commercial point; but so long as men shall desire pleasant
homes,&mdash;where the eye is as desirous of drinking in
draughts of pleasure and beauty as the pocket is of accumulating
wealth,&mdash;where mills, farms, gardens, and
pleasant enclosures can be had,&mdash;where the products of
the fields are garnered with a short transportation to a
ready market&mdash;just so long will Walla Walla and not
Wallula be the chief emporium and point of business for
the interior, and for supplying the more immediate demands
of the Walla Walla Valley. That Wallula will
always be a point where commission houses, a few stores,
and one or more hotels will always be supported, no one
can doubt; but looking toward a large and growing city
with all the pleasant appurtenances that make life happy,
I can not but conceive that its growth must become circumscribed
within the above limits.</p>

<p>We took passage on the pleasant steamer Tenino, and
in eight hours were landed at Celilo, a point some two
miles below the Des Chutes Landing, where the Oregon
Steam Navigation Company have already formed the nucleus
of a thriving village. The freshet of the past season
has strewn the banks of the Columbia with cord wood in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
abundance&mdash;which commands $10 per cord. The John
Day's wood yard, however, is the chief depot for fuel.
Here, too, one notices the marked progress that is daily
making its onward march to the interior. Here we saw
two steamers building, one already launched, owned by
Captain Gray, and still another at Celilo, of large dimensions.
There is no doubt we are far in advance, in point
of boldness and daring, in the question of river navigation
on the Columbia, of those similarly engaged on the
eastern waters; and the success which has thus far attended
the efforts of those who dared to move in the navigation
of the Upper Columbia, has only emboldened
them to greater efforts, and it is no dream to feel that the
day is not far distant when the Snake to the American
Falls, and the stretches of the Columbia from Wallula to
Fort Colville, and the Clark's Fork, from Park's Crossing
to Horse Plain, will all be tested by steam and thus made
tributary to the growing wants of trade and travel.</p>

<p>The fare from Wallula to Celilo is $10. A ride of three
hours brings us to The Dalles&mdash;which point, too, is showing
visible signs of a healthy improvement; and the increasing
trade to the mines of John Day's and Powder
rivers is destined to make it a point of great commercial
import. Whether the idea entertained by Mr. Newell,
and other men at The Dalles, of a direct trade from San
Francisco to The Dalles, shall ever be realized, is not so
easy to be determined. It certainly has a favorable location
for the full consummation of such an idea&mdash;and we
all know what magic results gold can be made to produce,
and without desire of detriment to Portland, I should
heartily desire to see such a happy result attained. The
will to do it, and the means with which to do it, are the
only two essentials needed; and if these are had, it will
be done&mdash;and the sooner the two former are ascertained
the sooner will the commercial idea (grand in its conception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
and pregnant with so many grand results) become a
matter of past history. The railroad company have resumed
the work of grading and ballasting, and it is the
desire of the company to have the cars running by the
first of next May. The roadbed is prepared for some five
or six miles out from the city, and the iron track laid for
half a mile. My own convictions are that the railroad,
eventually, is to be more beneficial to Walla Walla than
The Dalles, but that the latter is also to derive much
benefit no one will doubt.</p>

<p>We found the line of opposition steamers running,
which, having the tendency to reduce the rates of freight
and travel, was a thing that the commercial and traveling
public were but too glad to see. The passage from The
Dalles to Portland was only one dollar. That competition
on this immense line will be fraught with healthy
results no one will doubt. The Oregon Steam Navigation
Company, as the pioneers on an untested river, do
certainly merit much credit for the bold hazard they so
successfully made, and merit reward as such; and though
many complaints (founded in justice, doubtless,) have
been urged, still the history of all monopolies has shown
a greater degree of extortion than I have heard urged
against this company. But so long as the Columbia
River shall remain an open sea I do heartily desire to see
competition seek here a channel of investment&mdash;and
which it will always do so long as it is found to pay. All
philanthropic ideas of "parties desiring to serve the
public, without being remunerated," will find no believers
among the merchants and travelers of the Upper Columbia.
The merchant and traveler will take that line where
the rates are the lowest and accommodation the best,
irrespective of the owners of the line or those who pioneered
them through to a success. At least this is the
history of the commercial past, and I see no reason why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
it should not be the history of the commercial future.
Just so soon as capitalists find that putting steamers on
the upper Columbia is a paying investment, steamers
will be put on; and, unless the capitalist is so convinced,
it will be a difficult task to cause him to turn his capital
into such a channel.</p>

<p>This age is, preëminently, an <i>utilitarian</i> one; in which
facts and figures are, particularly, the weapons with
which the capitalist wages his financial war. Armed with
these, his victory is in his own hands; not so armed,
it is in those of some one else. The portage of the
Cascades, heretofore so great a bugbear in the trip from
The Dalles to Portland, is now made in a brief hour on
the cars, without detriment or danger. An extra dollar
for riding on the cars is charged, though, if you prefer
it, you can walk on the road in nearly the same time,
free of cost. No traveler passes over this portage without
awarding to Colonel Ruckle every praise for the bold
prosecution of his bold project, and no one begrudges
him the ample reward which he is to-day deriving in
token of his past labors. This portage is on the Oregon
side; but it is to be hoped that the difficulties on the
Washington side, between Bradford and Bush, will be
speedily adjusted, so that the steam cars, now running
on a portion of the track already completed, shall connect
the two termini of the portage, and thus reduce the
time of travel within the minimum limits. The post at
Fort Cascades is now abandoned, nor does it seem at
present necessary to hold it under garrison, so far as the
Indians are concerned. The question of a foreign war,
however, would render it a key-point of marked importance.</p>

<p>A run of seven hours brings us to Portland. I fear,
from the present appearance of Vancouver, that all
chances of commercial rivalry with Portland have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
banished. Capital is certainly not seeking it at present
as a point of investment. The freshet has left its marks
of devastation along the levee and lower portions of the
city, and it will require much capital and energy to reinstate
Vancouver in the position it occupied two years
since; and if the idea of making The Dalles a large commercial
emporium be ever consumated, I can not conceive
that Vancouver will ever occupy a position of more than
secondary importance, unless the western slopes of the
Cascades should open up a gold-bearing region. In such
an event Vancouver would necessarily become a point of
fixed commercial importance; but so long as the permanency
which now marks Portland shall continue to be
maintained, and the question on the part of the citizens
of The Dalles to make it a commercial depot shall continue
to be agitated, so long will Vancouver stand the
chance of being kept in the background. On the Lower
River we traveled to Portland in company with quite a
a number of emigrants destined to Puget Sound, and
they all regretted that they could not have gone from
Walla Walla to the Sound by land. This is a matter in
which every citizen of Washington Territory is more or
less interested. The road opened in 1853, by the Natchess
Pass, has fallen into such a state, that, unless repaired
and kept so, it will be useless for all practical purposes
of emigrants for the Sound from the States. I understand
that the Packwood trail is deemed by many preferable
to the Natchess route; but whether we shall have
a route via the Natchess, Snoqualmie, Packwood, or any
other pass, is a matter about which those truly interested
in seeing the Sound section brought directly in communication
with the interior, will not fall out. The citizens
of the Sound need a good road across the Cascades, direct
from Wallula. The valley of the Yakima will doubtless
give us a good line, and then across to the Wenatchee,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
via Packwood's Pass, either into Olympia or Steilacoom.
The long interval which has elapsed since the Natchess
Pass was traveled has naturally caused the line to fall
out of repair. The emigrants who desire to locate on the
Sound need a line by which they can carry their wagons,
and over which drive their stock, and not be driven to
take the steamers down to Monticello, thus increasing
costs so heavy that it seems impracticable. This is a
matter of great importance, not only for emigrants, but
in order to bring the citizens of the Sound, by the most
direct trade and associations, with those resident on the
eastern slopes of the Cascades,&mdash;and is one of such importance
that it is to be hoped that the attention of Congress
will be duly called to it. Military necessity calls
for such a line, and a military road should be so located
and constructed.</p>

<p>The large crowd that daily assembles on the wharf on
the arrival of the steamer from The Dalles is an unerring
barometer of the interest felt in the development of the
upper country; and a conversation with the leading
merchant of the city convinced me that the trade of the
Willamette&mdash;where the returns to the merchants are in
flour, grain, hides, and fruit,&mdash;is small and of minor importance
compared to that whence their returns are by
daily steamers and in gold dust. The latter is immediately
converted into coin and seeks new channels of
investment, and is turned over a half-dozen times a year,
whereas the former must bide its fortunate market and
sales thus delayed from week to week and from month to
month. The establishment of a branch mint, either at
Portland or The Dalles, is becoming a subject of daily
commercial necessity, and should such a branch be established,
if the treasurer was allowed, as soon as the assays
were made and the value of the certificate of deposit
made known, to pay out the coin immediately for these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
deposits, much time would be saved to the depositor, and
much gain and saving to the miner, whereas now, without
a branch mint, the miners are forced to sell their dust
to speculators, who must be paid for their time; and this
payment is kept up till it reaches San Francisco&mdash;here
from fourteen to twenty days are consumed before the
dust is coined&mdash;though not more than two days before
the value of the deposit by the assayer is determined.
The treasurer has always on hand an amount of funds
which could be paid out for the deposits made, which
deposits, when coined, could replace that paid out, thus
benefiting the miner by bringing him directly in contact
with the Government, who has eventually to coin his
dust, and save him time and "shaving" by the speculator,
and to this extent materially benefits the country
by distributing and disbursing the money in the very
same region where it is dug from the earth. A branch
mint for Oregon and Washington, and an authority for
the assistant treasurer to pay out at once the value of the
deposit as soon as the assay is determined, are two things
which, if effected, would materially tend to benefit the
miner, and hence the country; whereas now the time
consumed in sending the dust from the mines and getting
it back in coin must be paid for by somebody, and that
somebody ever has been, and, unless these changes be
made, will always be the miner. Just as quick as the
dust of the miner is returned to him in coin in the minimum
space of time and with the minimum "shave"&mdash;which
in this case would be only the cost of transporting
it to the branch mint and back,&mdash;then will the capital
of the country be in the hands of the greater number, and
that number a class of people who are interested in the
material interest and prosperity of the country&mdash;and
thus on [will our] roads, rivers, and works of internal improvement&mdash;our
schools, academies, and all the elements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
of social and substantial happiness and wealth be added to
and quickened by an impulse that is healthy in itself,
and which aims at and desires healthy avenues of investments.
Should such a branch mint be established, Portland
would doubtless claim the site; but whether it be
there, at The Dalles, or Walla Walla, is not a subject upon
which there should be any feeling. Let us have it at one
of these points; and if there is any one point where arguments
could be adduced to determine the matter to the
exclusion of the others, that point is at Walla Walla.
For it is here whence the greater bulk of gold dust must
flow; and if not here, then at The Dalles&mdash;the great
Golden Gate of the Upper Columbia.</p>

<p>Desiring to see a section of the country through which
I had never passed we took the stage from Portland to
Sacramento, which at the end of the first day's journey
brings us to Salem&mdash;where I determined to lay over a
day to visit the woolen factory, and observe the characteristics
of the place. The ride through the Willamette
from Portland to Salem is pleasant and refreshing,&mdash;large
and well-tilled farms, orchards of great proportions, with
their trees ladened with the golden fruit&mdash;peaches, apples,
and pears, in most profuse abundance; neat and
well-trimmed gardens, where the poetry of horticulture
bespoke the appreciation of the owners of well-tilled acres.
The style of farms, buildings, barns, and outhouses were
all in good taste, and indicated the extent of means of
the farmers of Oregon. The orchards of Oregon during
the past twelve years have proven to be a source of golden
wealth; nor is their value in the least diminished by the
large amount of fruit being now raised in California.
Many have asked where Oregon would find a market for
her orchards when California should produce her own
fruit, and though it is more than doubtful whether California
will ever rival Oregon in the growth of apples, yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
if this should prove to be the case, the mining sections of
eastern Oregon and of Washington are to-day sending
forth a message to all fruits growers to dry, preserve, and
can all their fruits, and they offer even to-day a golden
market that must forever consume all fruits so preserved;
and I have no doubt but that those who will turn their
attention to this employment of preparing fruits, either
as dried or canned, must always reap a golden reward
for their labors. I noticed at several points that attention
was already being much given this species of labor,
and the future will prove that the mining sections for
dried fruits will guarantee an equally lucrative market
for Oregon, that California has proven for her in green
fruits in times past.</p>

<p>In point of natural beauty I do not think that the Willamette
Valley compares favorably with the smaller but
equally well cultivated valley of the Rogue River; but
when we see once a magnificent outlet for all the produce
of the farmer, and the absence of such an outlet in the
latter, we are forced to prefer a home in the Willamette&mdash;where
Ceres has erected her temple of large proportions,
and where her votaries are annually basking in the sunshine
of her smiles, her bounteous plenty. In passing
through this rich and exuberant country I could not but
regret that the donation law that first opened homes to
the first settlers of Oregon was as generous as it was in
the largeness of its grant&mdash;six hundred and forty acres,
in other words, was too large a grant for the full and
truly healthy growth of any new country. True, it required
a great inducement to turn a pioneer colony
toward the Pacific so early as '46 and '47; but I verily
believe that one half the grant would have brought as
many settlers as double the amount has done. The true
index, doubtless, of the prosperity of a country might be
regarded the ratio of its population to the square mile;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
but when we find only one settler to the square mile,
the country, from necessity, must be sparsely populated;
and this condition must hold for so long a period that
detriment on a large scale must be felt. That the donation
act has had, therefore, its disadvantages with its
advantages no one I think will doubt,&mdash;taking the present
as the standpoint from which to view the prosperity
of the country. This, coupled with the fact that the
lands were taken without any regard to the points of
compass&mdash;thus ignoring our system of land surveys, so
simple and yet so beautiful,&mdash;I can not but regret that
the action of our Government could not have foreseen
some of the detrimental results into which its generosity
has led it. Of course, it is among the things of the past,
but not on that account the less to be regretted. The
experience in this matter may not, and, probably, never
will find any field for application&mdash;for the spirit of all
preëmption, homestead, and donation laws, as since
passed, has studiedly held two things in view, namely,
the minimum amount of land commensurate with the
object to be attained by their cession and the most rigid
adherence to the points of the compass in their location.
In referring to the donation act, I do not cavil at the
generous action of a generous government&mdash;for I but
too well appreciate that it has had the effect to open to
our grasp a golden continent, with avenues of trade
and with wealth&mdash;which has built up a line of battlement
of half a million of Freemen; not probably, in
looking at the results attained, it might seem ungenerous
to object, at this late date, to any of those measures
that assisted even in part to bring about this result. But
I am rather disposed to believe that the agricultural districts
of the Pacific were occupied and filled more in consequence
of the gold discoveries and to supply their wants
than from the spirit which pervaded the donation acts;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
for the latter antedating the discovery of gold on the Pacific
did not point out the market where the produce of
well-tilled fields should be sold. The coincidences of that
date, however, were most happy.</p>

<p>At Salem we found the legislature in session, and the
excitement incident to the election of Mr. Harding as
United States Senator having subsided, the body were
moving in such business as looked toward the growing
wants of the State. I found in Mr. Harding a plain, unpretending,
and sensible gentlemen, and in whom the
interests of Oregon will find a true representative. At
the invitation of Governor Gibbs I visited the Committee
of the State Fair, composed of delegates from all the
counties. It was here decided to make Salem the site
for holding the annual fairs; a point so central, so well
suited in every respect, that there seemed to be great
unanimity of sentiment in the matter. The grounds
around are open and spacious, and you feel that you
breathe the air and tread the ground of a rural city, in
making a tour of its extent. It is one of the most beautiful
localities I have seen in Oregon&mdash;on the right bank
of the Willamette, with beautiful shade trees, neat cottages,
not cramped or huddled together, but with ample
spaces for gardens&mdash;with a fine view of the woods, which,
in a vista of twenty miles, surround it&mdash;and, in the background,
with the bold slope of the Cascades, renders it one
of the most beautiful sites for a city to be found in Oregon.
It is not only the political center of Oregon, but it is
also destined to become a point of great manufacturing
importance. It is surrounded by fine forests of oak, fir,
pine, cedar. The large fields of grain here cluster around
it as the center. Its pioneer woolen factory, turning its
hundred of spindles, here rears its head, thus attracting
toward it every milling interest. The same stream that
turns its gristmills, turns its sawmills&mdash;and even then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
the water is not allowed to run to waste, but is again
caught and harnessed up to the spindles of industry where
the covering of the back of the sheep of yesterday is converted
into a covering for your own back of to-day. No
one resident north of California can visit the woolen
factory of Salem without a feeling of pride and of pleasure;
and as he sees the bales of blankets, of clothes,
and of flannels, lading the wagons which stand ready to
be freighted for every homestead in Oregon, he feels the
glow of pride in thus seeing our own looms weaving
wools of our own growth, and desires instantly to robe
himself in garments that no foreign hand has woven,
and from wool grown from flocks no alien hand has
tended. Let "Home Industry" be patronized, home
products be consumed, and the country will be benefited
to such an extent that we shall not have idlers to stir up
mischief nor rebels to stir up rebellion in either the North
or South. Mr. Rector, the obliging and gentlemanly
head of the factory, showed me through the compartments
and gave me some valuable statistics relative to
its annual growth. His intention is to double this year
the number of spindles. The surplus wool, heretofore
shipped to New York, will be retained and manufactured
at home; thus, our clothes and blankets will all be supplied
from wool which all can grow. Mr. Rector finds
difference in the wools grown on the east and the west of
the Cascades, and preference being given to the latter, as
containing more oily or fatty matter, and hence requiring
less oiling in the process of manufacturing. That grown
to the east of the Cascades is thought to be not only drier
but harsher&mdash;more dirty&mdash;but time and the proper attention
to its culture will doubtless bring about changes.
New breeds, housing in winter, and dry foothills for grazing,
are all advantages which wool growers to the east
of the Cascades can have on their side. There are few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
regions where finer grazing fields are to be had than the
slopes of the Bitter Root Mountains; and the freedom
from excessive dampness, the pure, fresh mountain
springs, are all so many advantages, that I confidently
look forward to the day when these many well-grassed
slopes shall be covered with fleecy flocks, and when the
waters of the many silvery streams that now flow through
the Walla Walla Valley, shall be caught and used to turn
the wheels of a woolen factory, from which shall be turned
out all the fabrics needed to clothe the population destined
to find homes to the east of the Cascade Mountains.
The clothes made by the Salem factory compare favorably
with those imported. One thing certain, there is no cotton
in their fabrics. Flannels of every hue are turned out
at forty cents per yard; blankets from $4 to $8, according
to texture; and clothes from 75 cents to $1.50 per yard,
according to fineness. It would be a most happy result
if every merchant, farmer, miner, and professional man
in Oregon and Washington would determine in his own
mind to have at least one suit of clothes made from Salem
cloth, and every bed to be covered by at least one pair of
Salem blankets. This would be affording a practical
proof of our pride in seeing established in our midst
these factories, which must eventuate in the profit of
individuals. It is much to be regretted that the immense
and illimitable mill power at Oregon City is not now
turned to good account. The disasters by fire and flood
of the Linn City mills have been of such a sad character
that the tendencies now are to intimidate capitalists, at
least for a time, from embarking in similar investments
at the same site. A substantial railroad is being built
around the portage at Oregon City, destined to diminish
the time and cost of shipment up and down the Willamette.
The season for practicable steam navigation
to the upper points of the river being over, but little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
business could be noticed on the part of those engaged
in this enterprise.</p>

<p>While in Salem I called the attention of Judge Humason,
of Wasco, and of Governor Gibbs, to the importance
of establishing a mail line from Walla Walla to Fort
Laramie, to there tap the present daily overland mail
service, by which means our mails at Walla Walla could
be delivered in fifteen days from Saint Louis, and in
seventeen days to Portland&mdash;this in the summer season&mdash;or
twenty to twenty-two days in the winter. At present
our mails cross the continent to Sacramento, two thousand
miles; thence to Portland, seven hundred; thence
to Walla Walla, three hundred more; making a total
of three thousand miles to travel before we get them;
whereas I can guarantee a line by the route indicated of
one half the distance and one half the time. I framed
a memorial, which Judge Humason would introduce in
Congress, for this line; and was promised by Mr. Harding
his coöperation to see that the matter was not allowed to
pass unnoticed during the coming winter.</p>

<p>Leaving Salem, a journey of twenty-four hours passes
us through Corvallis and Eugene City; and through an
exceedingly beautiful and rich agricultural country on to
Oakland, where the celebrated "Baker Mills" are established,
producing, it is said, the finest flour in Oregon.
The disasters of the flood were too visible at each and
every point, sweeping away bridges and ferries, and destroying
property to the extent of thousands of dollars.
A large structure across the Umpqua, costing $10,000,
was thus carried off&mdash;its convenience being now replaced
by a ferry. All along the road we passed small parties of
immigrants who crossed the Plains this season; some in
search of new homes; others to join their friends who
years since had preceded them. The Umpqua is a beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
valley in a high state of cultivation; the school-houses,
dotting here a hill, and there a valley, betoken
that the education of the youth of the country was not
being neglected. Roseburg, the county seat of the Umpqua
region, is a gem of a village; streets neatly laid out,
and neat, white, frame cottages, giving the place a rare
picturesque beauty, where mountain and dale, and the
hand of refined culture, all joined in beautiful harmony.
The line of telegraph posts extends throughout this entire
distance from Portland to Canyonville&mdash;the farthest point
south where they are as yet erected. It is fully anticipated
to have the line from Salem to Portland in working
order by winter; as also the line from Jacksonville to
Yreka. The posts are supplied and erected by contract
by the farmers and others living along the line, at a cost
of from $1.25 to $2 per post, and the line when completed
will cost $200 per mile. Local intelligence, and the interest
which every citizen feels in the reception of intelligence,
now bristling with so much import, will cause this
line, as soon as placed in good working order, to pay to
the stockholders fair dividends on their capital. This
link between Canyonville and Jacksonville will be completed
during the next season. I saw Mr. Strong in
Yreka, and found him pushing ahead the line with all
his characteristic energy. He deserves much credit for
prosecuting this project thus far to a success that is to
bring to our doors daily intelligence from the East, and
it is to be hoped that the citizens of the Upper Columbia
will move in the same matter as soon as the line is completed
to Portland.</p>

<p>A ride of twenty hours brings us into the Rogue Valley
and to Jacksonville, a region I regard as one of the most
beautiful and picturesque to be found in Oregon. The
valley is from twenty-five to thirty miles square, entirely
taken up by beautiful farms and under high cultivation;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
with farmhouses and barns in good keeping with the
character of its progress; grist and sawmills erected to
supply the wants of its inhabitants, and with inexhaustible
forests of timber. Gold mining is here carried on
with much success; and it was interesting to see the
lines of sluice boxes running through the streets of Jacksonville
that turned out as pretty gold as any mine on the
coast. Unfortunately for this fine valley, it has no outlet
for its produce, and is dependent solely on a home market.
Its supplies are brought in by the way of Crescent City,
by a good wagon road, at a cost of four to five cents per
pound. Oats here are 40 cents a bushel; wheat, 70 to
90 cents; lumber, $15 per thousand; labor from $30 to
$40 per month. We observed, in squads, the ubiquitous
Chinaman, moving from mining locality to mining locality,
fleeing from the kicks of one to the cuffs of the other,
with no fixed abiding place to be called his permanent
home.</p>

<p>A location for a railroad line from Portland to Jacksonville
is eminently practicable, and the citizens of the
Willamette will be blind to their own interests if they do
not so move in the matter so as to secure to themselves the
advantages of the ample provisions made in the Pacific
Railroad Bill for a connection between Portland and Sacramento;
but south from Jacksonville there will be a
severe problem for the engineers to solve, both in the
shape of grades and tunnels. The Calapooia range will
present an easy problem for solution; but the Scott's
[Siskiyou?] and Trinity mountains will not be easily
handled. They are high, broad, and broken, and no railroad
line can be laid across or through them, except at most
enormous cost. But that it is practicable, and will in time
be built, I have no doubt. But my views relative to this
location as a branch of the Pacific Railroad have been more
than confirmed by a detailed view of its geography, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
still insist that a branch of the Pacific Railroad that will
benefit Oregon and Washington as such can only be found
by tapping the main trunk at or near Fort Laramie, and
coming into the Columbia at or near the mouth of Snake
River; and thence using the main Columbia to such a
point whence freight can be shipped to and across the
ocean. I made special inquiries relative to the depth of
snow across the Calapooia, Scott's and Trinity mountains
during the past winter, and learned that not less than
eight feet fell upon these mountains; still the stage coach
passed these mountains every day until the freshet suspended
the travel; which was for the period of six weeks.
The Scott's and Trinity mountains are higher than any
mountains crossed by my road from Walla Walla to Fort
Benton; and knowing that the question of snow with us
is no more difficult than that met and overcome on this
and other lines, I am sanguine to believe that a mail line
from Fort Laramie to Walla Walla will prove eventually
practicable. But the <i>experimentum crucis</i>, that will leave
no lingering doubt even with the most uncompromising
cavalier, will be afforded us, I trust, during the next twelve
months; and that will deliver at our doors in Walla Walla
the mails direct from Saint Louis in fifteen days. I am
but too anxious that this last crowning success should be
afforded us; not only to give us increased mail facilities
for the present, but to awaken a practical attention to
that region where the <i>isothermal</i> and <i>isochimal</i> lines have
for ages past presented, and do still continue to present,
to us meteorological phases as wonderful in their nature
as they are destined to prove useful in their future results.</p>

<p>To those who derive pleasure in seeing the rough,
rugged, wild face of Nature, made to wear the smiles of
civilization and of progress, and to witness what money
and labor can accomplish, I know of no point where they
can visit to see these in all their grandeur than across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
the Scott's and Trinity mountains, which, in point of
difficulty and rugged wildness, surpass any mountain
region it has ever been my lot to travel, from the Columbia
to the Missouri River. Toll roads lead over both of
these mountains; one connecting Yreka with Rogue
River; and the other, Yreka with Shasta. The road
over Scott's Mountain is about twenty miles long, and
made at a cost not far from $200,000; and the other, eight
miles, made at a cost of $16,000. The mind that conceived
the road, and the hand that executed it, were not
cast in Nature's ordinary mould; genius of a higher order
was Nature's gift to them. Those who invested their
capital (for they were both built by private enterprise)
are now being well repaid; of this, the long line of
wagons and pack trains, freighted from Red Bluff to the
northern mines, furnish unmistakable evidence.</p>

<p>A ride over Scott's Mountain amply repays one for all
the labor required to make it; and can be made by no
one who will not appreciate that bold enterprise that is
to-day leveling mountains, leveeing valleys, bridging
torrents, and, by the sound of pick and drill, even arousing
Nature from her lethargy sleep&mdash;deep down in the
very bowels of the mountains&mdash;throughout the length
and breadth of California.</p>

<p>Leaving Rogue River, we pass at once from an agricultural
to a wild, mountainous region, which constitutes
the mining section of northern California, of which Yreka
may be considered the center. It is a place of much
trade, built mostly of brick, and presents a bustling
appearance. It supports two newspapers, three or four
hotels; has a large post office, and, at present, is the
northern terminus of the State telegraph line. A cemetery,
well arranged in its plan, forms the northern entrance
to the city; the number of graves it contains shows
that here as elsewhere death has done its work. A day's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
journey, and we come to Shasta, a mining town of one
thousand people, possessing few attractions outside of a
business locality. The road, approaching Yreka, winds
near the northern base of Mount Shasta, a frowning snow
peak, fourteen thousand feet above the level of the sea.
Though grand and majestic, it does not compare favorably
in either respect with Mount Hood&mdash;the father of
all snow peaks on the Pacific. From Shasta a ride of a
day brings us to Red Bluff&mdash;to which point steamers of
light draught are still running from Sacramento, but
with so many delays and uncertainties that the traveler
prefers to continue the journey by the stage. At this
point, however, we finally emerge from the mountains of
California and enter upon the broad swelling prairie
which constitutes the norther portion of the Sacramento
Valley&mdash;where, though the country is mostly a waste,
dotted here and there with clumps of oak, or openings of
the same growth, yet where many large and inviting
farming sections are had. At Tehama we cross the Sacramento,
by a buoy-ferry, and, in a few miles, enter upon
one of the most choice agricultural districts the eye ever
rested upon&mdash;where grain fields are not measured by the
acre, nor yet by the mile, but by the league. By a day's
drive we passed through the extensive and rich fields of
Major Bidwell, where eleven thousand acres of grain were
being threshed&mdash;where his own mill stood ready to convert
into flour the produce of his own fields; where his
own mammoth store furnished hundreds of his employés
with all the wants of life; where his own energy was
opening, with his own means, a wagon road from the
Sacramento River to the Humboldt mines; and where
his own purse has already paid out $35,000, and backed
by a willingness to pay as much more, in order to open
up a new market for the exuberant products of so rich
a soil as he himself possesses. The center of his large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
estate is the beautiful village of "Chico," where, in rural
wealth as well as in rural simplicity, live an educated
and contented peasantry, all more or less supported by
the means of this bachelor millionaire&mdash;whose residence,
on the banks of the Sacramento, is one of those architectural
gems hid away amidst shrubs, trees, orchards, and
groves, as if to avoid the gaze of him whose residence is
of crowded cities and who is almost unworthy to breath
the sweet perfume of a region where such bowers grow.
May Major Bidwell long live&mdash;though bachelor he be&mdash;to
dispense his bounties to a people who respect him for
the liberal and generous manner in which he shares his
wealth with those not similarly blest.</p>

<p>From Tehama the ride of half a day brings us to Oroville,
a city well named, for situated as it is on the
Feather River, it is in the heart of a rich mining country,
where the miners have worked like so many beavers,
and where the water of the Feather River is made to run
in pipes and reservoirs into lakes for hundreds of feet
above the level of the river, at the site of the town. This
river is crossed by a ferry. A steamer is said to have
once landed here from Sacramento, but such occurrences
I regard as rare. The river is rapid; boils and surges
over a rocky and rugged bed, and joins the Sacramento at
Marysville&mdash;to which point a night's ride brings us&mdash;continuing
to pass through a rich agricultural region,
under a state of high cultivation. Marysville is a large,
prosperous city&mdash;houses, mostly of brick&mdash;at the junction
of the Yuba and Feather rivers. Thence on to Sacramento,
(a journey of eight hours' staging,) the road is
over a level, agricultural district, throughout which the
piles of drift timber and the absence of fences, in many
places, and the presence of boats and bateaux, all told
that the water had been here supreme not many months
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
past; barns with their roofs a mile distant; houses without
any; outhouses and dwellings with a watermark up
to the second story&mdash;and in many localities no dwellings
at all, where commodious and comfortable tenements had
been&mdash;all told of the presence and the power of the
waters of Sacramento when charged with fullness on its
way to the ocean. It seems to me that a system of high
levees is the only thing to reclaim hundreds of acres of
fine swamp land along the Sacramento, and to prevent
the repetition of these disastrous results, which made the
people poor and retard the growth of the State. Sacramento
is already surrounded by a high levee which may
protect it another season; but the levee should begin at
Marysville and extend to Sacramento. It will, of course,
be expensive, but it will repay the labor in the end.</p>

<p>Between Marysville and Sacramento we passed the
large and magnificent claim called "Sutter's Ranch,"
though not under a high state of cultivation. The old
pioneer is now poor, but his friends are sufficiently zealous
in his behalf to see that his wants go not unsupplied.
One can not pass over this region and at the same time
observe how rapidly the Sacramento River is being obstructed
by the immense deposits of sand and sediment
which its current is daily bringing down, thus forming
bars and deltas destined not only to intercept but probably
to suspend at no distant day navigation to its upper
waters,&mdash;without feeling the pressing importance of a
railroad connection between Sacramento and the more
northern regions of California. Already are parties out
viewing and prospecting a road through Noble's Pass,
where it is proposed by some to carry the Pacific railroad
line.</p>

<p>That California will be covered with a network of railways
is only a question of time, and that time determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
by the low rates of interest that will cause capitalists to
become interested in these great works of internal improvement.
Local trade and travel must always be great,
and must always increase so long as gold shall be mined,
and that period seems to be illimitable.</p>

<p>From Sacramento we took passage on the fine steamer
Antelope, for San Francisco, which in six hours and at a
cost of $5 brought us to the end of one section of our
journey. There are no opposition steamers on now and
hence the monopolists command the river. The signs of
the devastation of the flood marked the entire distance
from Sacramento to the bay of San Francisco. But here
and there we found the inhabitants raising their dwellings
a story, and by levees and other improvements
trying to reclaim their fields, as well as to defy the
freshets of coming years. No one can pass over this exceedingly
interesting region from Portland to Sacramento
without feeling a thrill of pride and of pleasure
to see what American energy and American capital have
accomplished during the past fourteen years of its occupancy;
and to picture in imagination what the next
fourteen years may produce, would almost render oneself
liable to such an unjust criticism that I would forbear
to enter upon a theme so pregnant with interest;
suffice it to say, let those who have not made the trip,
make it at least once and see for themselves pleasant
homes and well-tilled fields, grand mountains, useful
rivers, forests of orchards, and oceans of grain; miles of
sluice boxes and tons of gold; and the beauty of a region
redolent with the songs of thrift and industry&mdash;and if
they be not well repaid for all the fatigues of a mountain
journey, the fault will certainly be theirs, and not the
bounty of generous nature, who with lavish hand has
spread so many pictures of the grand and beautiful&mdash;nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
yet the fault of the inhabitants by the wayside, who
by culture and improvement have framed these pictures
in gilded and golden casements, and where contentment
and happiness are the visible garments in which everything
would seem to be enrobed.</p>

<h3>INDIAN WARS OF SOUTHERN OREGON.</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Address of Hon. William M. Colvig Delivered at the Reunion
of the Indian War Veterans, at Medford
on Saturday, July 26, 1902.</span></p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>I was first invited to deliver an address of welcome
to the Indian war veterans, who meet here to-day; but
within the past few days I was informed that an historical
sketch of early days in southern Oregon, including an
account of the Indian wars, would be my part in the programme
of exercises.</p>

<p>My knowledge of the subject is not very extensive. I
lived in southern Oregon as early as 1852, but was only
a boy, not old enough to take part in any of the stirring
incidents which I remember of those days. I see before
me faces that recall events long past, and which left
pictures in the album of memory that time will never
efface, and you will pardon me if I refer to one of those
personal recollections.</p>

<p>In 1855 my father, Dr. Wm. L. Colvig, and family lived
in a log cabin on the South Umpqua River, near Canyonville.
One bright, clear day in October of that year,
myself and brother, on returning from a trip in the
"cañon," saw standing, in an exhausted condition, a
white cayuse pony before the door of our home. The
horse was covered with blood. Everything seemed quiet
about the place. We rushed into the house and saw a
man lying on his back, full length, upon the puncheon
floor. His clothing was partially removed. His body
was covered with blood. Father was kneeling over him
on one side and mother on the other. They were dressing
his wounds. He had nine separate bullet holes in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
limbs and body. Doctor Colvig had his case of surgical
instruments at hand, which consisted of a butcher knife
and a pair of scissors. The knife was the one we had used
to cut meat when crossing the plains. Mother was preparing
bandages by tearing up some of our old "hickory"
shirts. Well, they patched Uncle Bill Russell&mdash;called
"Long Bill" in those days&mdash;up in pretty good shape.
I see him here to-day, but I don't think that he is looking
for a fight with Indians. At the time of which I speak,
he had been shot by the Indians about five miles from my
father's house but succeeded in riding to our door. His
companion, Weaver, had a close call, but escaped unhurt.</p>

<p>The Indian wars of southern Oregon were stubborn
contests. It is a natural law that the fittest survive, and
wherever civilization in its advance meets barbarian force,
the latter must give way. When they meet there is an
"irrepressible conflict," the details of which we can not
always reconcile with the Golden Rule. The tribes who
took part in these several wars in southern Oregon were
the Rogue Rivers, Modocs, Klamaths, Shastas, and Umpquas.
The only honest acquisition of the Rogue River
Indians was their name. On account of the thieving and
treacherous habits of the people of that tribe, the river
which flows through the valley was called by the early
French trappers "Riviere aux Coquin," the river of
rogues. The Oregon legislature in 1853 sought to change
the name, and did name it Gold River, but, as the boys
say, "it didn't take."</p>

<p>It will be impossible for me to do more than mention
a few of the more prominent incidents, and I can not be
very accurate in regard to dates and other matters pertaining
to that period, as my information has been gathered
from many sources, some of which are not very
authentic.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to know that on December 27,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
1850, Congress passed what is known as the donation
land law, which gave to every American citizen over the
age of eighteen years, if single, one half section of land;
if married, one section of land, one half of which was the
absolute property of the wife, the other half of the husband.
There were no settlers in the Rogue River Valley
prior to New Year's day, 1851. In the spring of 1851
a man by the name of Evans constructed a ferry across
Rogue River, just below the town of Woodville. During
the same spring a man by the name of Perkins also established
a ferry on that river. The first donation land
claim was located by Judge A. A. Skinner, an Indian
agent, in June, 1851. This claim is the Walker farm,
near Central Point. Upon it he built the first settler's
house ever built in the valley. Chesley Gray, his interpreter,
also located a donation land claim in June, 1851.
It is what is known as the "Constant Farm," near Central
Point. The following named persons filed donation land
claims prior to February, 1852: Moses Hopwood, on
Christmas day, 1851; N. C. Dean, at Willow Springs,
December, 1851; Stone and Poyntz, at Wagner Creek,
December, 1851; L. J. C. Duncan, Major Barron, Thomas
Smith, Pat Dunn, E. K. Anderson, and Samuel Culver
had made their locations prior to February, 1852. I do
not pretend that these were all, but the entire number of
claims taken up to that time did not exceed twenty-eight.</p>

<p>In December, 1851, James Clugage and J. R. Poole
located the first mining claim in southern Oregon, at a
point near the old brewery in Jacksonville. They had
been informed by a couple of young men who were passing
through the country that they had found gold near
that place. Immediately after this discovery became
known in California and by the incoming immigrants to
Oregon, there was a rush made to the mines of Jacksonville.
Old man Shiveley, the discoverer of Shiveley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Gulch, above Jacksonville, inside of eighteen months had
taken out over $50,000, and since that time, from the
best statistics obtainable, the mines of southern Oregon
have yielded about $35,000,000 in gold.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1852 flour was sold at $1 per
pound, tobacco at $1 an ounce, and salt was priceless.
Jacksonville was laid out as a town in the summer of
1852 by Henry Klippel and John R. Poole.</p>

<p>I will now speak of the Indian wars in which the people
of southern Oregon were engaged. The first recorded
fight between the Indians and whites in any portion of
southern Oregon occurred in 1828, when Jedediah S.
Smith and seven other trappers were attacked by the Indians
on the Umpqua River, and fifteen of the whites were
slain, only Smith and three of his companions escaping.
The next fight of which we have any account was in June,
1836, at a point just below the Rock Point bridge, where
the barn on the W. L. Colvig estate stands. In this fight
there were Dan Miller, Edward Barnes, Doctor Bailey,
George Gay, Saunders, Woodworth, Irish Tom, and
J. Turners and squaw. Two trappers were killed, and
nearly all were wounded. Within my recollection, Doctor
Bailey visited the scene of this fight, and pointed out to my
father its location. In September, 1837, at the mouth of
Foots Creek, in Jackson County, a party of men who had
been sent to California by the Methodist mission to procure
cattle, while on their return were attacked by the Rogue
River Indians and had a short, severe fight, in which
several of the whites were badly wounded and some
twelve or fourteen of the Indians killed. In May, 1845,
J. C. Fremont had a fight with the Indians in the Klamath
country; it may have been a little over the line in California.
Four of Fremont's men were killed and quite a
large number of the Indians. Kit Carson was a prominent
figure in this battle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p>As before stated, a few bold adventurers had located in
Rogue River Valley as early as December, 1851. During
the spring, summer, and fall of that year there was a considerable
amount of travel through the valley, by parties
from northern Oregon going to and returning from the
great mining excitement of California. Fights between
these travelers and the Indians were of frequent occurrence.
On the fifteenth day of May, 1851, a pack train
was attacked at a point on Bear Creek, where the town
of Ph&oelig;nix is now situated, and a man by the name of
Dilley was killed. On June 3, 1851, a party of Oregonians,
under the leadership of Dr. James McBride, had a severe
fight near Willow Springs with Chief "Chucklehead"
and his band. Chucklehead and six other Indians were
killed; several of the whites were severely wounded.</p>

<p>About this time Maj. Phil Kearny, afterwards General
Kearny, who was killed at the battle of Chantilly in the
Civil war, happened to be passing through the valley on
his way from Vancouver to Benicia, California, with a
detachment of two companies of United States regulars.
He remained a short time and assisted in punishing the
Indians for the numerous depredations committed by
them during the year. He had several fights while in
the valley, in which about fifty Indians were killed. One
of these fights was on Rogue River, near the mouth of
Butte Creek, where Captain Stuart, of the United States
army, received an arrow wound from an Indian, who was
also wounded. The arrow penetrated the captain's body,
and he died the next day at the camp on Bear Creek,
near Ph&oelig;nix. The camp thenceforth took the name of
Camp Stuart, and Bear Creek in all government records
is called Stuart's Creek. The captain's body was buried
at a spot where the wagon road crosses the mill race in
the town of Ph&oelig;nix. Some years ago his remains were
taken up and sent to Washington, D. C., to be buried by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
the side of his mother. Captain Stuart's last words
were, "Boys, it is awful to have passed through all the
battles of the Mexican war, and then be killed by an
Indian in this wild country."</p>

<p>At the massacre of emigrants at Bloody Point, Klamath
County, in 1852, thirty-six men, women, and children
were murdered. Capt. Ben Wright and twenty-seven
men from Yreka and Col. J. E. Ross and some Oregonians
went out to punish these Modocs. Old Schonchin, who
was afterwards hung at Fort Klamath in 1873, at the
close of the Modoc war, was the leader. Wright gave
them no quarter. He and his men, infuriated at the
sight of the mangled bodies of the emigrants, killed men,
women, and children without any discrimination&mdash;about
forty in all; and it is said that they asked for a "peace
talk," whereupon a roast ox was prepared. Wright
poisoned it, gave it to the Indians, and then rode away.
[This story is now generally discredited.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>]</p>

<p>I can not give you the names of all who were killed in
Rogue River Valley during the years 1851, 1852, and
1853. I will mention some that were killed in 1853. In
August of that year Edward Edwards was killed near
Medford; Thomas Wills and Rhodes Nolan, in the edge
of the town of Jacksonville; Pat Dunn and Carter, both
wounded in a fight on Neil Creek above Ashland. In a
fight with the Indians on Bear Creek, in August, 1853,
Hugh Smith was killed, and Howell, Morris, Hodgins,
Whitmore, and Gibbs wounded, the last named three
dying from their wounds soon after.</p>

<p>These murders, and many more that could be mentioned,
brought on the Indian war of 1853. Southern
Oregon raised six companies of volunteers, who served
under the following named captains, viz, R. L. Williams,
J. K. Lamerick, John F. Miller, Elias A. Owens, and
W. W. Fowler. Capt. B. F. Alden, of the Fourth U. S.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Infantry, with twenty regulars, came over from Fort
Jones, California, and with him a large number of volunteers
under Capt. James P. Goodall and Capt. Jacob
Rhoades, two Indian fighters of experience. Captain
Alden was given the command of all the forces. The
first battle of the war was fought on the twelfth day of
August, 1853, and was an exciting little fight between
about twenty volunteers under Lieut. Burrell Griffin, of
Miller's company, and a band of Indians under Chief
John. The volunteers were ambushed at a point near the
mouth of Williams creek, on the Applegate. The whites
were defeated with a loss of two killed and Lieutenant
Griffin severely wounded. There were five Indians killed
and wounded in the battle. On August 10, 1853, John
R. Harding and Wm. R. Rose, of Captain Lamerick's
company, were killed near Willow Springs. On the sixteenth
of August, 1853, Gen. Joseph Lane, afterwards
United States senator from Oregon, and a candidate for
vice president in 1860, came out from his home in Douglas
County and brought fifty men with him, to take part in
the war. General Lane was a man of large experience
in Indian warfare and in all military matters. He had
commanded an Indiana regiment in the Mexican war and
enjoyed a well earned reputation for bravery. On the day
that General Lane arrived what is known as the battle of
Little Meadows was fought. Lieutenant Ely and twenty-two
men met the Indians near Evans Creek, in the timber,
and a short, but deadly conflict took place. Seven
whites were killed inside of an hour; Lieutenant Ely and
three men wounded. They left the battlefield in charge
of the Indians&mdash;at least, in the popular phraseology of
that day, "they got up and got out." On August 24,
1853, the battle of Evans Creek was fought. In this fight
the Indians did not fare so well, twelve of them being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
killed and wounded. One volunteer named Pleasant
Armstrong was killed and Captain Alden and Gen. Joe
Lane were each wounded. During the summer of 1853
several men were shot by Indians in Josephine County.
In the fall General Lane patched up a temporary peace,
which lasted till 1855.</p>

<p>The war of 1855-56 was preceded by a great many murders
and depredations by the Indians in different parts of
southern Oregon. I will mention a few: &mdash;&mdash;. Dyar and &mdash;&mdash;. McKew,
killed while on the road from Jacksonville to
Josephine County on June 1, 1855. About the same time
a man by name of &mdash;&mdash;. Philpot was killed on Deer Creek,
Josephine County, and James Mills was wounded at the
same time and place. Granville Keene was killed at a
point on Bear Creek, above Ashland, and J. Q. Faber was
wounded. Two men, &mdash;&mdash;. Fielding and &mdash;&mdash;. Cunningham,
were killed in September, 1855, on the road over the Siskiyou
mountains.</p>

<p>On account of these various depredations Maj. J. A.
Lupton raised a temporary force of volunteers, composed
of miners and others, from the vicinity of Jacksonville,
about thirty-five in number, and proceeded to a point on
the north side of Rogue River, opposite the mouth of
Little Butte Creek. There he attacked a camp of Indians
at a time when they were not expecting trouble. It is
said that about thirty men, women, and children were
killed by Lupton's men. The major himself received a
mortal wound in the fight. This fight has been much
criticised by the people of southern Oregon, a great many
of them believing that it was unjustifiable and cowardly.
Two days after this affair a series of massacres took place
in the sparsely settled country in and about where Grants
Pass is now situated. On the ninth day of October, 1855,
the Indians, having divided up into small parties, simultaneously
attacked the homes of the defenseless families
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
located in that vicinity. I will name a few of those tragic
events. On the farm now owned by James Tuffs, Mr.
Jones was killed, and his wife, after receiving a mortal
wound, made her escape. She was found by the volunteers
on the next day and died a few days afterwards.
Their house was burned down. Mrs. Wagner was murdered
by the Indians on the same day. Her husband
was away from home at the time, but returned on the
following day to find his wife murdered and his home a
pile of ashes. The Harris family consisted of Harris and
wife and their two children, Mary Harris, aged twelve,
and David Harris, aged ten, and T. A. Reed, a young
man who lived with the family. Mr. Harris was shot
down while standing near his door, and at a moment
when he little suspected treachery from the Indians with
whom he was talking. His wife and daughter pulled his
body within the door, and seizing a double-barreled shotgun
and an old-fashioned Kentucky rifle, commenced
firing through the cracks of the log cabin. They kept
this up till late in the night, and by heroic bravery kept
the Indians from either gaining an entrance into the
house or succeeding in their attempts to fire it. Just
back of the cabin was a dense thicket of brush, and during
a lull in the attack the two brave women escaped
through the back door and fled through the woods. They
were found the next day by volunteers from Jacksonville,
our late friend, Henry Klippel, being one of the number.
Mrs. Harris lived to a good old age in this county. Mary,
who was wounded in the fight, afterwards became the
wife of Mr. G. M. Love, and was the mother of George
Love of Jacksonville and Mrs. John A. Hanley of Medford.
David Harris, the boy, was not in the house when
the attack was made, but was at work on the place. His
fate has never been ascertained, as his body was never
found. The Indians stated, after peace was made, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
they killed him at the time they attacked the Harris
house. Reed, the young man spoken of, was killed out
near the house.</p>

<p>On October 31, 1855, the battle of Hungry Hill was
fought near the present railway station of Leland. Capt.
A. J. Smith of the United States army was at that battle,
and a large number of citizens soldiery. The result of
the battle was very undecisive. There were thirty-one
whites killed and wounded, nine of them being killed outright.
It is not known how many of the Indians were
killed, but after the treaty was made they confessed to
fifteen. The Indians were in heavy timber and were
scarcely seen during the two days' battle.</p>

<p>In April, 1856, after peace had been concluded between
the whites and Indians, the Ledford massacre took place
in Rancherie Prairie, near Mount Pitt, in this county, in
which five white men were killed. This event was the
last of the "irrepressible conflict." Soon afterward the
Indians were removed to the Siletz reservation, where
their descendants now live and enjoy the favors of the
government which their fathers so strongly resisted.</p>

<p>The war in Rogue River Valley had now virtually ended.
"Old Sam's" band, with an escort of one hundred United
States troops, was taken to the coast reservation at Siletz.
Chiefs "John" and "Limpy," with a large number of the
most active warriors, who had followed their fortunes
during all these struggles, still held out and continued
their depredations in the lower Rogue River country and
in connection with the Indians of Curry County.</p>

<p>Gen. John E. Wool, commander of the department of
the Pacific, in November, 1855, had stopped at Crescent
City while on his way to the Yakima country. He received
full information while here of the military operations
in southern Oregon. Skipping many details, it is
sufficient to state that he ordered Capt. A. J. Smith to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
move down the river from Fort Lane and form a junction
with the United States troops under Captains Jones and
E. O. C. Ord (afterward a major-general in United States
army), who were prosecuting an active campaign in the
region about Chetco, Pistol River, and the Illinois River
Valley. Captain Smith left Fort Lane with eighty men&mdash;fifty
dragoons and thirty infantry. I can only take the
time to mention a few of the fights in that region during
the spring of 1856. On March 8th Captain Abbott had a
skirmish with the Chetco Indians at Pistol River. He lost
several men. The Indians had his small force completely
surrounded when Captain Ord and Captain Jones with
one hundred and twelve regular troops came to his relief.
They charged and drove the Indians away with heavy
loss. On March 20, 1855, Lieutenant-Colonel Buchanan,
assisted by Captains Jones and Ord, attacked an Indian
village ten miles above the mouth of Rogue River. The
Indians were driven away, leaving several dead and
only one white man wounded in the fight. A few days
later Captain Angne's [Augur?] company (United States
troops) fought John and "Limpy's" band at the mouth of
the Illinois River. The Indians fought desperately, leaving
five dead on the battlefield. On March 27, 1855, the
regulars again met the Indians on Lower Rogue River.
After a brisk fight at close quarters the Indians fled, leaving
ten dead and two of the soldiers were severely wounded.
On April 1, 1855, Captain Creighton, with a company of
citizens, attacked an Indian village near the mouth of the
Coquille River, killing nine men, wounding eleven and
taking forty squaws and children prisoners. About this
time some volunteers attacked a party of Indians who were
moving in canoes at the mouth of Rogue River. They
killed eleven men and one squaw. Only one man and two
squaws of the party escaped. On April 29, 1855, a party
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
of sixty regulars escorting a pack train were attacked
near Chetco. In this fight three soldiers were killed
and wounded. The Indians lost six killed and several
wounded.</p>

<p>The volunteer forces of the coast war were three companies
known by the names of "Gold Beach Guards," the
"Coquille Guards," and the "Port Orford Minute Men."
I have not the time to enter into the details of the battle
that was fought on the twenty-seventh of May, 1855, near
Big Meadows, on Rogue River. Captain Smith was in
command of his eighty regulars. Old "John" lead the Indians.
The operations covered a period of two days, John
using all the tactics of military science in handling his
four hundred braves during the battle. Just as everything
was ready, according to "John's" plans for an
attack upon the regulars, Captain Angne's [Augur?]
company was seen approaching. The Indians were then
soon dispersed. Captain Smith lost twenty-nine men
killed and wounded in this battle, and had it not been
for the timely arrival of Angne's [Augur?] company, his
men would all have been killed.</p>

<p>While these operations were being carried on by the
United States troops, the volunteer forces were not idle.
They were kept busy with "Limpy" and "George's" warriors,
at points in Josephine County. On January 28,
1856, Major Latshaw moved down the river with two
hundred and thirteen men. He had several skirmishes
and lost four or five men in killed and wounded. On
May 29th "Limpy" and "George" surrendered at Big
Meadows to Lieutenant-Colonel Buchanan. On May 31st
Governor Curry ordered the volunteer forces to disband&mdash;nearly
all the Indians had surrendered. About one
thousand three hundred of the various tribes that had
carried on the war were gathered in camp at Port Orford.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
About July 1, 1856, "John" and thirty-five tough looking
warriors, the last to surrender, "threw down the hatchet."
I have now gone over, in chronological order, the principal
events connected with the Indian wars of southern
Oregon. I am fully aware that the narrative is very defective,
and that many events of importance have not even
been mentioned. You who took part in these early struggles
can easily fill in the gaps, and correct the errors that
I may have unconsciously made.</p>

<p>There were some men who took part in the Indian wars
of southern Oregon who afterward became prominent in
the history of the Nation. I will name a few, viz, Gen.
U. S. Grant, Gen. J. B. Hood (late of Confederate army),
Gen. Phil Kearny, Gen. Wool, Gen. A. J. Smith, Gen.
Geo. Crooks, Gen. A. V. Kautz, Gen. Phil Sheridan, Gen.
J. C. Fremont, Gen. Joe Lane (candidate for vice president
of the United States in 1860), Gen. Joe Hooker
(who built the military road in the Canyon Mountains in
1852), and Kit Carson.</p>

<p>We all rejoice that the general government has at last
acknowledged the value of your services to civilization;
and has made some provision of recompense for the privations
which you suffered.</p>

<p>I see before me old gray headed mothers who will also
share with you this recognition of the Nation's gratitude.
It is well, and to my comrades of the Civil war, who are
here, and who have been the promotors of this reunion of
veterans, let me say that no women of any war, in which
the American people have ever been engaged, are more
deserving of the Nation's bounty than these old, feeble,
pioneer mothers of southern Oregon. When their fathers,
brothers, and husbands went out to meet their savage
foes, these women were not left in well protected cities,
villages, and homes, but often in rude cabins, situated in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
close proximity to the conflict; and unlike the chances of
civilized warfare, no mercy could be expected from the
enemy&mdash;surrender meant not only death, but torture and
heartless cruelty. In every hour of those dark days these
women proved themselves to be fit helpmates to a race of
daring men&mdash;and worthy all honors that are accorded
the brave.</p>

<h3>MINTO PASS: ITS HISTORY, AND
AN INDIAN TRADITION.</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">John Minto</span>.</p>

<p>There was a tradition among the Indians of the central
portion of the Willamette Valley at the time when
the missionaries of the Methodist Episcopal Church attempted
christianization from 1834 to 1840, that a trail
or thoroughfare through this natural pass had formerly
been much used by their people and that its use was
abandoned after, and as one of the results of, a bloody
battle between the Mollalas (who claimed the western
slopes of the Cascades from the Clackamas River south
to the Calapooia Mountains,) and the Cayuses who were
originally of the same tribe, but who had become alienated
by family feuds, of which the battle or massacre of
their tradition was the end. The superstitious belief of
the Indians in the transmigration of the souls of dead
warriors into the bodies of beasts of prey, like panthers,
bears, and wolves, would of itself go far to cause the Indians
to abandon the use of such a trail, but the formation
of the gorge by which the river cuts its way through
the roughest portion of the range is such as to give great
numbers of opportunities for ambuscades&mdash;a common
resort of Indian warfare. Certain is it that for some
cause the Indians of Chemeketa, Chemawa, and Willamette
spoke with dread of going up that river. They
did, however, have trails on each side of this natural
pass,&mdash;that to the south being first used by a pioneer settler
named Wyley. It became known as the Wyley Trail,
and subsequently was adopted as a general route over
which the Willamette Valley and Cascade Mountain Military
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
Wagon Road was located. The other to the north
comes into the Willamette Valley via the Table Rock and
down the Abiqua. Both these trails were used exclusively
by the Indians of the east side of the range as means
of coming into the Willamette Valley with the exception
of the Mollalas, who were intermarried with the Warm
Springs Indians and the Klamaths when the settlement
by the whites began. The free trappers and the retired
Canadians, who had settled as farmers and trading parties
of the Hudson Bay Company, continued to use the
trail up the North Santiam Valley until 1844-45, when,
in addition to the country reached by it being "trapped
out," furs fell in price in the general market so that it
temporarily ceased to be used by the engagees of the
Hudson Bay Company. In the summer of 1845 Dr. E.
White, then a sub-agent of the United States for the Indians
of Oregon, examined, or claimed to have examined,
the route as a means of getting immigration into western
Oregon more easily than by way of the Columbia River
Pass. Either the doctor did not examine closely or was
very easily discouraged; at all events no beneficial results
followed. At this same time Stephen L. Meek was
leading a party of the immigration of that year with the
purpose of entering the Willamette Valley by that way.
Meek had trapped on the head waters of the John Day
River a few seasons previous, and had here met Canadians
from the Willamette, who had come over the trail
and doubtless thought he could easily find it; and there
is little reason to doubt that he would have done so had
it not been that by reason of their much wandering in
searching the way from the mouth of the Malheur to the
waters of the Des Chutes, the people he led were in such
desperate straits that he had to flee for his life. There
was another reason: a ridge makes out on the east side
of the main range, but parallel with it, which completely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
shuts the pass from being seen in outline from the east.</p>

<p>The failure of Meek to get his party through raised the
question in the settlements as to whether there was so
easy a means of passing the Cascade range at that point
as the Hudson Bay Company trappers and traders represented,
and in the spring of 1846 a public meeting was
held at Salem and a committee of six citizens was selected
to go and make an examination of the trail. Col. Cornelius
Gilliam was the head of the committee of the American
portion of the party, and Joseph Gervais, a Canadian
trapper, preëminent for general intelligence among his
class, went along to show the way. The Hon. T. C. Shaw,
nephew of Gilliam, was of the party (the youngest). He
is at present (1887) county judge of Marion County, and
recently went over part of the ground they then passed.
From him it is learned that the trail did not then pass
through the narrow gorge which has been spoken of, but
took over the tops of the most broken and rugged portion
of the range. The party proceeded until they came to what
they termed the "scaly rock mountain," which Colonel
Gilliam pronounced impassable for wagons. The party
returned and reported accordingly, and from that date
till late in 1873 that pass way was unused and to a great
extent forgotten.</p>

<p>In October, 1873, two hunters in search of good game
range penetrated up the north bank of the river through
the gorge before mentioned, and found that about twelve
miles from the then settlement on King's Prairie that the
valley widened out and the mountains seemed lower;
narrow belts of bottom land lay between the mountains
and the river, and appeared to continue up to near the
base of Mount Jefferson, which, in fact, they do. One
of these hunters (Henry States) sent for John Minto, being
unable, on account of a sprained ankle, to go to the latter,
and told him of their findings. This rediscovery or new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
discovery revived recollections of statements made by
Joseph Gervais and others, and Minto took sufficient interest
in the subject to go before the board of county
commissioners of Marion County and repeat the statements
of the hunters, volunteering the suggestion that
it was important if such a natural pass existed as was
thus indicated the county had an interest in making the
fact known. One of the commissioners, Hon. Wm. M.
Case, had long lived near neighbor to the famous Hudson
Bay Company's leader, Tom McKay, and had often heard
him speak of that as the shortest and best way across the
Cascades. A short consultation resulted in the "order"
that Mr. Minto take two comrades and proceed up the
valley of the North Santiam until he was satisfied whether
it made such a natural cut into the range or not. After
an absence of twelve days the party returned and Minto
reported a deep valley apparently almost dividing the
range, and so sheltered that several varieties of wild
flowers were found in bloom on the eighteenth of November.
Upon this representation a petition for the survey
of a road was presented to the board of county commissioners
early in 1874, and the viewing out and survey of
such a road ordered, Porter Jack, Geo. S. Downing, and
John Minto to act as viewers, and T. W. Davenport as
surveyor. The survey was made and the viewers' report
in favor of an excellent roadway was made to the county
commissioners of Marion County, August, 1874. The
results were got by following up the north bank of the
Santiam River, generally within sight or sound of its
waters, from the point where it enters the Willamette
Valley to its most eastern springs. Starting from the
bank of the Willamette River at Salem, where its course
is east of north parallel with the Cascade range, the survey
leads up its Santiam branch eighty-three (83) miles,
to the true summit of the Cascades, here found in a narrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
cut or pass lying across the summit ridge, the general
course of the survey being southeast by east. From the
summit thus found it is an estimated distance of only
five (5) miles down to the Matoles branch of the Des
Chutes River, here running east of north parallel with
the range, the same course as that of the Willamette on
the west side; but taking down the eastern declivity with
an easy grade for a wagon road, the plain of the Des
Chutes would be reached in about seven miles and the
Willamette Valley and Cascade Mountains Road, where
it skirts the base of Black Butte, three miles into the
Des Chutes plain, in about ten miles. In making this
view and survey an old and deeply worn trail was frequently
crossed, and such a trail, less deep, was found
leading over the pass eastward. The first observed trail
gives some support to the Indian tradition of a former
native thoroughfare down the valley.</p>

<p>The trail out of the pass is not so much worn, neither
is the Strong trail leading off towards the west from a
point about seven miles eastward, used by Lieutenant
Fremont as he passed the locality in 1843. The trail so
noted reaches first the immense springs of Matoles, where
a full grown river rises from under the northeast base of
Black Butte, into which the salmon ascend in July and
August for spawning purposes, at that date and since
making a valuable fishery for the Indians, and scarcely
less valuable as fisheries where the numerous lakes to the
westward, which, taken in connection with abundant
game of the entire region, make it a hunter's paradise.
At the date of Fremont's march, of which had Meek
been informed in 1845, he would have almost certainly
succeeded in getting the people he led into the Willamette
Valley by that way easier than they reached The Dalles
after he abandoned them.</p>

<p>After the viewing out and survey of the wagon road
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
as before related, parties incorporated or filed articles of
incorporation for a projected railroad through the pass
to Winnemucca. It was a mere speculation on the part
of persons who had neither money nor credit of any kind.
It had the effect of weakening the public interest in having
a common road constructed, so that after the lapse
of the legal hold on the pass thus attained, there was
little disposition to spend money on the opening of a
common road which was liable to be destroyed at any
time by a railroad interest. An association was formed,
however, and a stock trail was opened at a cost of $1,800,
in labor. As much more spent at that time would have
enabled wagons to pass. For lack of this small sum the
trail constructed did not attract the public use except in
a small measure for horses. In 1880 Hon. John B.
Waldo, while enjoying a summer recreation trip along
the summit ridge, came to a point some seven or eight
miles south of the point to which the survey had been
made and over which a trail had been opened, which he
felt confident was lower than it. He spoke of it to Mr.
Minto, who, the next spring, had a small sum ($200) placed
at his disposal by Marion County in order to remove obstructions
which had fallen into the trail. After removing
these obstructions that had fallen in during the previous
four years, Mr. Minto had $111 of the money left which
he asked permission of the board of commissioners to use
in viewing out and surveying the most southern of the
two main branches of the Upper North Santiam. The
suggestion was made that this arm of the stream trended
so far southward that it would probably be found to
reach the summit by a greater meander and consequently
afford a more gradual approach to this supposed lower
point of the summit, and therefore be more favorable for
railroad purposes. The order was made in accordance
with the suggestion, and Capt. L. S. Scott, Geo. S.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
Downing, and John Minto were appointed viewers and
T. W. Davenport surveyor. After some loss of time by
efforts to locate a line of communication, Minto took one
comrade and went eastward through the old pass, taking
the altitude of it as he went and finding it, according to
an ordinary barometer, such as is used by railroad surveyors,
to be five thousand five hundred and thirty-six
feet above the sea, and proceeding southward and then
westward on the same day found the instrument to read
at the point indicated by Judge Waldo, four thousand
nine hundred and eleven feet above the sea. From this
point a line was struck and surveyed, which by way of
the southeast branch of the North Santiam, connects with
the original survey by an easy grade for railroad purposes
and of which the projectors of the Corvallis and
Eastern railroad were immediately informed. An examination
of the whole route from Gates to Summit via the
last viewed section, was made by Colonel Eccleson, civil
engineer, and Summit was reached by a fraction over a
two per cent grade. Construction began at the Summit
with the least possible delay and rails were hauled by
wagon from Albany and laid in order to hold the pass.
From the pass westward more than half of the right of
way was cut and much of the grade made ready for the ties
between this lowest pass and the junction with the original
Marion County survey at what the party making it
called Independence Valley, directly south of and as the
bird flies about eight miles from the apex of Mount Jefferson.
From Idanha, the terminal of railroad track
laid, four miles east of Detroit, fully twelve miles of
right of way and grade were constructed when work was
suspended by the original railroad company. From Mill
City eastward to the Summit, the company appropriated
fully ninety per cent of the original surveys made at the
cost of Marion County. This need not be objected to,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
but in addition to this these railroad promoters often exercised
an assumed right to name points that will be of
permanent interest which they did not discover. This
seems hardly fair. From my point of view the Hon.
John B. Waldo, who first observed the apparent lowness
of the pass, and called my attention to it, is more entitled
to have his name attached to it than Col. T. E. Hogg,
whose name I understand was given to by J. I. Blair,
the railroad magnate of New York, who was one of the
chief supporters of Colonel Hogg's enterprise.</p>

<p>As a matter of some historical interest I will close this
paper by inserting some of the original names given
places and things by the first white explorers of the valley.</p>

<p>The stream named Breitenbush was named by Henry
States, Frank Cooper, and John Minto on the first legal
examination for the pass for John Breitenbush a hunter
who had cut his way to it ahead of them. Detroit was
named by the man from Michigan who first opened a
house for entertainment there. Boulder Creek was
named by T. W. Davenport on his survey notes in 1874.
It makes in from the north at Idanha which was a Muskrat
Camp of first surveying party, but renamed by the
proprietor of the first summer resort house. Minto Mountain
was named by some one unknown to the writer, after
he had led to the opening of a trail to Black Butte, in
Crook County, in 1879. It was the grass covered mountains
seen by Minto from the top of a fir tree into which
he pulled himself to get a view of their surroundings when
first seeking the pass in November, 1873, and which
grass land his associate, Frank Cooper, asserted was in
eastern Oregon, to his, Cooper's, personal knowledge,
though he would not risk climbing the tree to see it, being
a very heavy man. This mountain will for all time
be an attractive object to summer recreationists and
the most easily reached from the center of the Willamette
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
Valley when the railroad is extended twelve miles farther
east. The first stream making in from the northeast of
Boulder Creek was called, by the surveying party of
1874, the White, a first fork from Jefferson. In August
the snow melts from the southwest slopes of Jefferson and
runs through volcanic ash as fine as bolted flour and it
enters the main Santiam like thickened milk, coloring it
down to Mehama sometimes. Custom has adopted the
name "Whitewater." In 1879 I gave the name Pamelia
Creek to the next stream which flows off the south face
of Mount Jefferson and the same name now attaches to
the lake at its south base. The name was given for
Pamelia Ann Berry, because of her cheerfulness as one
of the girl cooks of the working party, of which her
father and sister were valued members. Independence
Valley was so named by the road viewing party in 1874.
Our party rested there on the fourth of July. The first
waterfall on the east branch was named Gatch's Falls
for Prof. T. M. Gatch, by election of the party, the young
members all having been his students. Marion Lake
and Orla Falls at the head of it were named at the same
time. The latter by the younger members of the company
who had danced with Miss Orla Davenport, the
oldest daughter of our surveyor. The most of the water
of Marion Lake seems to come over these falls from the
northern declivities, a rocky peak of many pinnacles,
locally called "Three-fingered Jack," but to which the
name of Mount Marion was given in the report of this
survey. This peak rises from the summit ridge south of
Mount Jefferson and north of Mount Washington about
equal distance of seven miles from each and about fifteen
miles from the most northern of the Three Sisters. There
are inviting situations for delightful summer residences
on or near the ridge, both north and south of Mount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
Marion, which will in the near future probably become
sites of permanent homes. The climate, as indicated by
plant life, is that of the Highlands of Scotland, as here
the American congener of both purple and white heather
is found on and near the summit ridge.</p>

<p>The writer, who was an active member of these first
exploring, surveying, and road constructing parties,
closes this with the statement that the rugged labor sometimes
involved was the very best kind of summer recreation,
where nature in all her varying phases was enjoyed
and the sights of the day made themes of camp fire talks,
intermingled with subjects connected with social, educational,
business, and public interests. There was little
difference in this respect between the camp fires of a
party of professional men seeking rest and that of road
makers constructing lines of development.</p>

<h4>ANSON STERLING CONE.</h4>

<p>Anson Sterling Cone, who came to Oregon in 1846, and
is now&mdash;February, 1900,&mdash;living upon his donation
claim a mile and a half from Butteville, on one portion
of French Prairie, is a native of Indiana, having been
born in Shelby County of that State in 1827. At the age
of seventy-three he is still in good health, and of good
memory. He is carrying on a large farm, and, together
with his wife, is supporting the family of his brother's
daughter, as his own. He is a man of medium size, of
rather sandy complexion, with hair and beard now white.
He is plain and straightforward in manner, and remembers
distinctly many details of his early experiences in
Oregon. Some of the most interesting features of his
narrative are his meeting with Whitman; his service as
juror on the trial of the Indian murderers of Whitman;
and his trip overland to California in the first wagon
train to the mines. His story, however, will be given as
he relates it, and the reader may then use his own judgment
as to the relative importance of his recollections.</p>

<p>With his father's family, who removed for a short
residence from Shelby to La Porte County, Indiana, he
went as a mere lad to Iowa. The farm occupied by his
father was alongside one of the main roads, and there,
year after year, he saw the emigrants in their great
wagons on the way to Oregon. In the course of time he
took the fever to go with them to that enchanted country.
The opportunity was not long withheld.</p>

<p>In 1846 a well-to-do neighbor, Edward Trimble, made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
up a party, in which an older brother of Anson's, Aaron
Cone, was to go. Obtaining permission of his father,
Anson, then but a youth of eighteen, assisted in helping the
train off, and drove with the party for some distance.
When the time arrived for him to return home (his dejected
appearance probably indicating his longing to go on with
the emigrants) Trimble said to him: "Anson, I don't
advise or ask you to go to Oregon; but if you are bound
to, you may go with me." "I have no outfit," said the
young man. "I have $1,000," answered Trimble; "and
as long as that lasts you shall have your share of it."</p>

<p>Anson went. His patron, however, never reached
Oregon. Trimble was one of the comparatively few who
fell a victim to the treachery of the Indians. He was
killed by the Pawnees, on the Platte River, near the big
island. He had been selected captain of the company of
forty-three wagons which was made up at Saint Joe,
where the train crossed the Missouri, and took the route
south of the Platte.</p>

<p>At a point opposite the big island, as then known, the
cattle were stampeded by the Pawnees, and driven away,
so that the train was left entirely without teams. Trimble
started out to hunt the animals; but his wife, seeing
that he had no arms, said to him, "Edward, you had
better take your rifle." He answered, "I do not need
it; I am only going to look for the trail." But reaching
a knoll and finding the trail of the lost stock, which led
to the river, he and a man named Harris rode on without
stopping, until they discovered the cattle on the
island. Going down to the river side, however, they
were suddenly confronted by a party of armed Pawnees,
who had secreted themselves under the steep bank.
Harris then, in his excitement, left his horse, and Trimble
delaying for him was shot by the Indians. His body
was not recovered but arrows stained with blood were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
found, which had probably been shot through his body.
These were preserved by Mrs. Trimble, and it is thought
that they are still in possession of the family; a daughter
of Trimble, having become Mrs. Pomeroy, of Pomeroy,
Washington.</p>

<p>By the men of the train who saw the affair, Harris was
rescued, and the most of the oxen, though in a sad state
of demoralization, were recovered. A considerable number
were never found, and on account of this seven
wagons were compelled to return to Saint Joe, with just
enough cattle to draw them. But the mischief was also
played with the oxen that went forward. After one
thorough stampede such animals are always unreliable.
Mr. Cone remembers one serious stampede later, of the
whole train on the road, which was started only by a
jack rabbit driven by the dogs under a wagon. "It was
a pretty hard sight," he says, "to see the wagon hauled
off, with oxen on the run. But they had to stop at last;
some fell down and were dragged along. Many an old
ox lost his horns. There were horns flying then&mdash;let
one catch his tip in the ground and it was gone!"</p>

<p>However, though under unusual strain from this unlucky
incident with the rascally Pawnees, the plains and
mountains were crossed at last. Fort Bridger, Fort
Hall, and the Grande Ronde and Blue Mountains were
passed in due order, and about the middle of October the
wagons descended upon the Umatilla.</p>

<p>Here the two young men, Anson and his brother Aaron,
thought it advisable to leave the train and push on to the
Willamette. To accomplish this they went over to the
Walla Walla, with the idea of working for Whitman long
enough to pay for a pack horse. At Waiilatpu they
found the doctor at home, and made known their intention.
"Boys," replied the Old Man (A. S. C.), "you
had better take Bob there, and all the provisions you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
need, and go at once. At the end of the season there will
be those coming who will have to stay here anyhow, and
I had better save the work for them. I will be down in
the Willamette country next summer, and you can pay
me then." The young men accordingly took "Bob," a
trusty old white cayuse horse and a good pack animal,
who had somehow lost his tail, all except a short stump,
just sufficient to hold the crupper.</p>

<p>By this kindness and confidence of Whitman Mr. Cone
was greatly impressed. "He was a good man," he says,
"he had a heart like an ox!" According to his recollections
Whitman was about six feet tall, straight as an
Indian and of fine presence. His face was florid, his
hair chestnut, and not noticeably gray. In manner he
was quick "for a big man," and "always in for anything
that had life"&mdash;sociable, and a good joker. The horse
and provisions, taken from the doctor's door, amounted
to about $25 worth; "and the next summer," says Mr.
Cone, "when I heard that the Old Man was at Oregon
City, didn't I rustle around to have the money ready for
him!"</p>

<p>Young Cone arrived at Oregon City on November 6th,
his nineteenth birthday. He began almost immediately
to look about the country, and taking the road to Tualatin
Plains, was surprised, but greatly pleased, to meet
on the way&mdash;at the house of Mr. Masters, near the
present town of Reedville&mdash;an old friend, whom he had
known at the East. This was T. G. Naylor, long a well
known resident of Forest Grove. By this hospitable
friend Cone was invited to spend the winter on the farm
on Gale's Creek, and actually spent two months, managing
to find eight working days between showers, out of
that time&mdash;which indicates that the climate, even then,
was rainy. However the young immigrant had good
health, enjoyed life, and grew fat. For his eight days of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
work he received an order for eight bushels of wheat, and
being in great need of new clothes, went back to Oregon
City, and obtaining work at rail splitting, he succeeded
in mending his fortunes sufficiently to procure new garments.
He also found work afterwards in the sawmills.
"Many a day," he says, "I worked alongside the Kanakas."
There was at that time a considerable number
of these native Sandwich Islanders in Oregon. They
were good workmen, says Mr. Cone, being especially
useful in work about the water. They had their own
quarters, which they kept themselves, and provided their
own sustenance quite independently.</p>

<p>During the dry season of 1847 the two brothers having
decided to return East across the Plains, made a long
tour of the Willamette Valley, in order to tell all about
Oregon, with which, however, they were not fully satisfied
as a permanent home; but their preparations not
being complete they were delayed until late in the next
season.</p>

<p>It was in August of that year that the Cayuse Indian
murderers were brought down from the upper country,
and were tried and hanged at Oregon City [Mr. Cone was
evidently confused in this part of his recollections as the
Cayuse Indian murderers did not give themselves up until
April 1850; and were tried later in that year.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor</span>.]
The Indians had the benefit of counsel, and the usual motions
were made for acquittal. Among others was rejection
of many jurymen, on the ground of prejudice. As it
began to seem that no jury could be found, Cone, who was
present as a spectator at the trial, whispered to a companion,
"Come, let's go; they will be getting us on the jury!"</p>

<p>They quietly slipped out, therefore, and retiring to a
big rock on the bluff, were engaged chatting. A young
man soon approached, however, whom they took to be
another like themselves, but they recognized that he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
after them and a deputy sheriff, when he proceeded to
summon them to the jury box. They were accordingly
impaneled, with the necessary number, and listened to
the evidence. The case was entirely clear, the prosecution
simply presenting evidence to show that the accused
were the Indians who had committed the crime.</p>

<p>As to the motive of the murder, or the causes back of
it, Mr. Cone inclines to the opinion very prevalent at the
time, that it was due to religious differences; "there
was another church there, and this I know, that none of
the other church were hurt." He mentions particularly
Joe Stanbough, who was not injured, yet was a full-blood
white man. This is mentioned here, and indeed is given
very cautiously by Mr. Cone, not as any brand for present
sectarian differences, but as a true reflection of opinion
at the time. The precise justice of that opinion is
not discussed here.</p>

<p>Very soon after the trial Cone was told by General
Lovejoy, at Oregon City, of the discovery of gold in California.
"If I were you," said Lovejoy, "I would go as
soon as possible." By this advice Cone and his brother
were led to get together three wagons and join the overland
company. This was a most eventful journey and
illustrates the capacity of the trained Oregon men.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Cone's recollections there were forty
one wagons; though Peter Burnett says, in "An Old
Pioneer," that there were fifty and one hundred and fifty
men. There was but one family in the train, the name
of which Mr. Cone has forgotten. In this he coincides
with Burnett. Cone also recalls Thomas McKay very
distinctly as the guide and virtual leader; who said that
he could take them through to the Sacramento River
without trouble; "and there is only one place that I
am afraid of; that is going down the mountain into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
Sacramento Valley. You may have to let your wagons
down with ropes there."</p>

<p>Burnett, in his vivid sketch of this journey, says that
he went to Doctor McLoughlin for advice, and was directed
by him to employ McKay, as this intrepid son of
the unfortunate Alexander McKay was acquainted with
every foot of the way and was especially efficient in dealing
with the Indians. But Mr. Cone recollects nothing
of Burnett.</p>

<p>As to Indian troubles, Cone says that there was only
one Indian killed. This was in the Umpqua Valley, and
the deed was without provocation, and by an irresponsible
young man, of the kind that hung on to almost every
party. McKay read the young man a severe lesson, and
complained to the company, endeavoring to show how
reckless such actions were. The young man made the
saucy reply that he must be still, or else there would be
another Indian killed&mdash;alluding to McKay's Indian
blood. However, there were no other natives disturbed,
and the way was through the country of the Klamaths,
the Modocs, and the Pitt River Indians. Burnett mentions
meeting a very few natives near the end of the
journey, but says there was no trouble whatever.</p>

<p>In the Pitt River Valley the Oregon wagon train came
upon the track of the California immigrants, whom Peter
Lawsen&mdash;or Lassen, as Burnett spells the name&mdash;was
guiding to his great ranch on the Upper Sacramento.
When at last overtaken they were found to be in great
destitution, and so exasperated at Lassen, who had lost
the way, and was wandering in the Sierra Nevadas, trying
to find a practicable way down their stupendous
western declivities, that he seemed in danger of his life.
A practicable descent was found at last, however, and
then began the race to see who would be first into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
valley. This was near Lassen's Peak, which is so high
as to be spotted with old snow, even to late autumn.</p>

<p>Here Mr. Cone describes "the maddest man he ever
saw." This was the pioneer, Job McNemee, of Portland.
With an extra good team and high determination of his
own he had declared that he would be first in the valley.
He was well on the way to success, having got and held
the lead; but halfway down the mountain side, in his
wild career, he ran his wheel against a protruding bowlder,
by which the heavy wagon was upset, and there it
lay, while the other wagons, nine in number, of that particular
section of the train, went bouncing by. But at
last, in spite of all accidents, men and animals reached
Lassen's ranch, and were there treated with royal hospitality.
The vaqueros were directed to slaughter beef,
and the Oregon men, as well as the California party,
were invited to the barbecue. The Oregonians, however,
were not likely to wait long. It was now late in November,
and though some went first up to Redding's ranch,
all soon struck out for Coloma. Although not an active
participant in the Indian troubles there, these are recalled
by Mr. Cone. He remembers the murder of the party of
Oregon men, recalling the circumstance, however, that
the number killed was five, and that one of the six escaped.
The Indians, as he remembers, were tracked to their
camp on the river, and attacked and punished.</p>

<p>His memory was more deeply impressed, however, with
the enormous price of provisions; as, for instance, going
down one day to Sacramento, and seeing some nice little
hams, he had a mind to purchase one. On asking the
price he was told four dollars a pound. He concluded
he did not want any. That was late in the season of '48
or early '49. Vast quantities of stores were shipped in
soon, and prices fell. Misfortunes robbed Mr. Cone of
the results of his adventure. His brother was taken sick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
and died. He was himself attacked by scurvy, and finally
being unable to work longer, sought passage home on a
sailing vessel, which crossed the Columbia bar late in
the fall of '49, a very smoky season, and of long drouth,
the vessel being becalmed for days together.</p>

<p>Mr. Cone remembers many amusing incidents of the
mining life; one of which was the shooting of Weimer's
pig by his partner&mdash;the animal being a nuisance around
camp, yet of great value. One morning the partner of
Cone said: "Load the gun and I'll shoot the &mdash;&mdash; sow."
To run the bluff, Cone did so, and not to be backed off,
the partner shot and killed. Then to hide their trespass
the carcass was hidden in the brush; but upon returning
at evening from their rockers the young men found that
the ravens had taken care of the pork.</p>

<p>In 1850 Mr. Cone, having recovered his health, located
a claim on French Prairie. His father arrived in Oregon
in 1851. His brothers, Oscar and G. A., Jr., came in
1847. Three other brothers also became Oregonians,
Oliver, Francis Marian, and Philander Johnson. All
found claims near each other on French Prairie, or just
across the river. Anson and Oscar are the only ones now
living.</p>

<p>Of the old father, G. A. Cone, there are eighteen grandchildren
and thirty-seven great-grandchildren.</p>

<p>Anson Cone was married in 1866 to Sarah A., the
widow of his brother Oliver, whose maiden name was
Wade, and who is herself a pioneer of '53.</p>

<h4>MRS. REBEKA HOPKINS.</h4>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins, the daughter of Mr. Peter D. Hall, who
perished near Fort Walla Walla&mdash;Wallula&mdash;after escaping
from the Whitman massacre, is now living on the farm
held by her first husband, Philander J. Cone. Although
past the age of fifty she is in good health, of prepossessing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
appearance, and of very active habits. Her cosy farm
home, which is on the prairie, but at the edge of the
grove, and shaded by some oak trees in the dooryard, is
ornamented also with choice varieties of flowers, especially
of roses, of which she has many rare kinds.</p>

<p>She was but five years of age when the massacre occurred;
and by the terror of that event all previous
recollections seem to have been completely obliterated.
She does not remember anything of her father; but of
the massacre itself, so far as her own observation went,
she still has a vivid picture in her mind. She recalls
the upstairs room where the women and children were
huddled together after Whitman was struck down, and
where Mrs. Whitman came after she was shot in the
breast. Mrs. Whitman, she says, was standing, when
wounded, at a window, and was washing the blood from
her hands, as she had been dressing the wounds of her
husband. Mrs. Hall was with her. It could not have
been apprehended that further murders would be committed,
and Mrs. Whitman must have been the equal
object of the Indians superstitious rage, as she was the
only woman killed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins remembers the appearance of the upstairs
room, and that the Indians were kept back from
coming up for a time by an old gun, which was probably
not loaded, but was laid so as to point across the stairway.
The savages would come to the stairway until
within sight of this gun barrel, and then afraid, or pretending
to be afraid, of its fire, would scamper back. Mr.
Rogers was with the women and children.</p>

<p>As to the death of her father, who escaped and sought
safety at old Fort Walla Walla, on the bank of the Columbia
River, but was refused admission, Mrs. Hopkins
believes he was killed near the fort. By Mr. Osborne,
who with his family, finally reached the fort, the clothes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
of Hall were seen and recognized. It was said to him,
when he exclaimed, "those are Hall's clothes," that Hall
had been drowned in attempting to cross the Columbia.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins considers the account of the massacre as
given in the June number of the <i>Native Son</i> [1899], which
was furnished by Mrs. O. N. Denny, as the most accurate
that she has seen. Mrs. Denny, Mrs. Hopkins' older
sister, who was about twelve years old at the time of the
tragedy, has a comprehensive recollection of the whole
affair.</p>

<h4>MRS. ANNA TREMEWAN.</h4>

<p>Mrs. Tremewan, now residing at Champoeg, has many
most interesting recollections of her early life. Although
now past middle age she is of magnificent physique,
being about five feet eight inches tall, straight as an
arrow and well proportioned, but at the same time of
that peculiarly supple mold and movement that so distinguishes
the French creoles. Her hair is still jet black,
and long and wavy and very thick; her eyebrows heavy
and black, and her features, though strong and marked,
refined and very intelligent.</p>

<p>Her speech is remarkably clear, every word being distinctly
pronounced, with rather an English or Scotch accent,
and in a full rich voice of rather low key. During
conversation her features light up noticeably, and though
she speaks deliberately she has no hesitation, never pausing
to think of a word or construction. She complains
of her poor memory for dates, but possesses a large fund
of family information, both of her own people and the
Hudson Bay Company.</p>

<p>Her mother was a daughter of Etienne Lucier, of
French Prairie; her father was Donald Manson, a trusted
captain of the Hudson Bay Company, and her first husband
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
was Isaac Ogden, a son of Peter Skeen Ogden,
governor during the latter years of the Hudson Bay
Company's occupation of Fort Vancouver. She is living
now at Champoeg, in the old house built by her father,
though now owned by herself with her husband.</p>

<p>Her brothers are men of education and ability; Donald
Manson, Jr., being a resident of Portland; James Manson,
living at Victoria; and William Manson, who was educated
in Scotland, being principal of a school at New Westminister,
B. C. Another brother, Stephen, no longer
living, who was named by his mother or his grandfather
Lucier, is described by those who knew him as a man of
remarkably handsome appearance, and bright intellect.
He was, as a boy, attending the school at Waiilatpu at
the time of the Whitman massacre, and although uninjured
was so shocked by the bloody occurrence that long
afterwards he would start from sleep crying out "The
Indians, the Indians!" There were two daughters besides
Anna (Mrs. Tremewan), Isabella and Lizzie.</p>

<p>The following are some of the recollections taken hurriedly
at a morning call of Mrs. Tremewan. In reply to
a question about her father she said: "My father was in
the employ of the Hudson Bay Company&mdash;you may have
heard of it. We lived until I was fifteen in British Columbia;
no, not at Victoria, but on the head waters of
Frazer River, at Stuart's Lake&mdash;you might call that a
little ocean. That was a long way from Victoria, though
that was our point of supplies, and my father made a
trip from there every year to carry out the furs&mdash;for that
was what he dealt in. He went a part way by river, and
a part way by horses. At Fort Langley he met the
steamer from Victoria, and from that point the goods
were brought up the river to our place.</p>

<p>"Yes, he used to leave us all alone at Stuart's Lake
every year while he made the trip, and that would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
from April to September. On one time I remember perfectly
well he came back on the seventh of September.
What makes me remember this was because it was then
my sister Lizzie was born, and my mother was still in
bed, and when the cry was made that the boats were
coming, we were all so eager to have papa see the baby.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Stuart Lake was a beautiful place, the loveliest
I have ever seen. The mountains were blue across
it, they are so far away. When the wind blew the waves
rolled up like a sea. The water is perfectly clear. When
we used to walk along the shore, or swim in the lake, we
could see to the bottom. It was full of fishes of all kinds;
salmon and sturgeon and trouts. I have often told my
husband that I wished I could see Stuart Lake again.</p>

<p>"But I was born in Alaska,&mdash;in the land where the
gold is now; at Fort Stikeen. The cabin was so near
the water that the waves rolled up against it. I have
have often heard my mother tell about it.</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember the trip out from Stuart Lake perfectly.
Our first stop was at Fort Alexandria; then we
came on by boat to a place called Kamloops, where we
waited a month while the horses were got together and
trained for the rest of the journey. We came on to Fort
Hope, and then by boat to Fort Langley. There we took
the steamer <i>Otter</i>. There were two steamers then, the
<i>Otter</i> and the <i>Beaver</i>; we had the <i>Otter</i>.</p>

<p>"I did not know what a Yankee was. I remember
that when I was on the steamer they used to say to me
'So you are going to be a Yankee!' I did not like it a
bit. We had more the English way of talking, and did
not say 'I guess.' It was a long time before we could
talk like the Yankees.</p>

<p>"When my father first came to Oregon he was pretty
wealthy and bought this place. But he lost so much in
the flood of '61 that he was nearly broken up. He never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
fully got over this&mdash;together with sickness and other
things.</p>

<p>"When the Hudson Bay Company was at Fort Vancouver,
and during the Whitman massacre, Ogden was
governor at the fort. Well, his son was my first husband&mdash;his
name was Isaac. Peter Skeen Ogden was a
wealthy old man; he was from Montreal. He left considerable
money to his children. He had four; Isaac, who
lived at Champoeg, where we were married; William,
who lives in Portland; Emma, who died at the age of
thirty; and Mrs. Sarah Draper, of McMinnville, who has
six children.</p>

<p>"My mother was a daughter of Stephen Lewis&mdash;I
think that would be the English of it; but the French
called it Lucier, Etienne Lucier. What makes me think
it was 'Stephen,'&mdash;I have heard mother say she named
my brother Stephen for his grandfather. My grandfather
was a Frenchman from Canada, and my mother was the
daughter of his first wife; I think she came from east of
the Rocky Mountains."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tremewan was well acquainted with Archibald
McKinley, who settled just across the river from Champoeg;
and the family of Mr. Pambrun, one of whose
daughters was Mrs. Dr. Barclay, of Oregon City; Mrs.
William Pratt, another; and Mrs. Harriet Harger, of
Chehalem Valley, another. Mrs. Harger has a family of
six daughters.</p>

<h4>EARLY SCHOOLS IN LANE COUNTY.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left45"><span class="smcap">Latham</span>, Oregon, February 6, 1902.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Mr. Geo. H. Himes, Assistant Secretary Oregon Historical Society, Portland,
Oregon</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: Your letter of 3d received [asking for data on early
schools in Lane County.] In response would say the first two schools
I remember in our district were taught by Mr. James M. Parker and
Mr. H. Clay Huston, in a log house on my claim in Lane County.
The branches taught were A B C's, spelling, reading, writing, arithmetic,
grammar, geography. I do not recollect which of these two
gentlemen taught first. I taught many terms of three months each
in various districts. In early days most districts were weak financially,
and but few could afford more than one term in a year. Public
money from school funds would not be quite enough to pay the
bill, and rate bill would be made for balance and collected from patrons.
The method of making rate bills would be to average and
find price per day per scholar, and number of days' attendance
per rate would be each scholar's fee. Sometimes a subscription
school would be gotten [up] at so much per scholar for the term,
the teacher taking the subscribers for pay.</p>

<p>The houses were either log, frame, or box, principally log, but as
fast as district became able improvements were made. Some had
huge fireplaces where red hot coals assisted the teacher's switch to
keep the outer boy and girl warm while he stored away his A B C's or
fed his mind on ab, ib, ob. Some were heated by stoves. Some would
have long, narrow windows, one on each side of the house, and under
them long desks fastened to the walls to write on, and long benches
for the writers to sit on; others would be constructed with plenty of
windows and reasonably comfortable seats and desks.</p>

<p>The books principally used were Sanders' and Webster's elementary
spelling books, Sanders' first, second, third, and fourth readers.
I think Montieth's geographies, Thompson's arithmetics, Smith's and
Clark's grammars. Teachers set most of copies for writers, but some
copy plates were used. Classes would be formed as much as possible.
A-B-C scholars would have to be heard singly, and those just commencing
to spell. Those in arithmetic would have to be attended to singly
except in general exercises on blackboard. Four lessons a day in
A B C's, spelling, first, second, and third readers; two in the fourth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
reader, besides closing spelling classes at noon and night. Often
these would consist of two classes, one class containing the smaller,
the other the larger scholars. One geography, one grammar, one
blackboard exercise for each class&mdash;about fifteen or twenty minutes,
set apart especially in fore and afternoon for writers, so teachers could
give them close attention. Commencing with the A B C's first, after
calling school to order, then the spellers, next first, second, third, and
fourth readers; mingled with this would be the necessary assistance
to the arithmeticians, geographers, grammarians. Classes having
recited, then write geography, grammar,&mdash;and blackboard exercise
heard, usually in the afternoon. Quiet could be better kept by requiring
the scholars to ask permission to speak when they wanted to
whisper, to leave their seats when wanting something in another part
of the room, or to go out when they wanted to leave the room. Compositions
would be better written, speeches committed to memory,
and read and delivered at stated times; spelling schools in winter at
night, and sometimes examination or exhibition on last day. Christmas
times were apt to be jolly times. The scholars made it a point to
get to the schoolhouse before the teacher and either bar him out or
catch him before he got in, carry him to a pond of water, and make
him treat. Teachers would sometimes board around among the scholars
and sometimes board at one place. The easiest, best way to control
the school was to make no rules only as needed; when irregularity
occurred, correct as required, with the understanding that no such
would be allowed the second time.</p>

<p>Patrons of the school furnished fuel, usually hauling wood, wagon
lengths, about ten or twelve feet long. Teacher and larger scholars
would chop it up for fires. Teacher or large scholars did the sweeping.</p>

<p>

<h4>THE MONTURES ON FRENCH PRAIRIE.</h4>

<p>In his history, H. S. Lyman speaks of "Montour, a
character considered fabulous by Bancroft, but said to
have made a settlement on French Prairie."</p>

<p>Referring to notes given me by Mr. L. H. Ponjade, one
of the old residents on French Prairie, I found the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
My father, the old French doctor, had studied at Montpelier, and
after receiving his diploma as surgeon and physician, was immediately
taken into the service of Napoleon, and served three years as surgeon
on the army of France, mostly in Spain. He naturally did not wish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
to serve in the army again, so came to America, found his way to
Oregon, and from force of associations, made his home on French
Prairie.</p>

<p>Our first camp was at the ranch of old man Monture, that at that
time looked like an old farm, as it was well improved. Peter Depot
then owned the claim where Gervais is now situated, and I understood
that he got it from Monture some time previous to that, but do not
know the particulars.</p>

<p>Monture had two sons, named George and Robert. Whether they
were both sons of the wife he then lived with I do not know, as morals
were rather loose previous to arrival of the missionaries. There was
a custom among ex-servants of the Hudson Bay Company to claim a
wife wherever they might be among the Indians. After the arrival
of Father Blanchet they were allowed to have but one wife.</p>

<p>I remember that George Monture was a very large man and very
powerful; must have weighed 350 pounds. I have seen him lasso wild
cattle and hold them to be branded without any cinch or other thing
to hold the saddle on the horse. He did it by mere weight and bodily
strength. He would do this for half a day together at a time.</p>

<p>Bob&mdash;as he was called&mdash;was not so large, but was stout and active.
He was a fine shot with his rifle.</p>
</div>

<p>When I saw this mention of "Montour," I wrote to
my old friend, L. H. Ponjade, to ask if his mention of
Monture meant the same that Lyman thus referred to,
and he confirms it as the same, and adds: "The old
place where they lived was about one quarter of a mile
west of Parkersville. Every man with any knowledge
of old settlers knows of the Montures."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Oregon Material Taken from a File of an Independence (Mo.) and
Weston (Mo.) Paper for 1844 and 1845; Also Some Minor Extracts
from Other Papers in That Vicinity.</span></p>

<p>During this time these towns were important outfitting
points for Oregon pioneers. The Oregon fever was raging
throughout the surrounding country, the frontier
counties of Missouri. The newspapers, Democratic and
Whig, in this vicinity appreciated the interest in the
Oregon Country and in the movement of emigration
thither. Their columns were open to reports of travelers
returning from the Columbia. Letters sent back by
pioneers in the Willamette Valley seemed to be in great
demand. The documents printed below contain two
noteworthy letters from persons who were in the great
migration of 1843. Contemporary sources of the history
of that epochal event are especially valuable.</p>

<p>[These extracts were made from the files of these papers
in the possession of the Missouri Historical Society, Saint
Louis, Mo.]</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
From the <i>Independence Journal</i>, September 12, 1844.<br />
(Vol. I, No. 1, G. R. Gibson, editor.)</p>

<p>"Civis," in a communication, dwells upon the importance of the
Independence trade in outfitting Santa Fé traders. One hundred and
fifty thousand dollars are annually expended at Independence for this
purpose. There are good reasons for believing that in a few years it
will quadruple that amount. Concerning the outfitting of the Oregon
pioneers, he says:</p>

<p>"The Oregon emigrants will, no doubt, continue to rendezvous near
this place, and will number annually 1,500 persons, the outfit for which
number will cost $50,000, and all of which our citizens may furnish."</p>

<p>Mountain trade, now of inconsiderable importance, will be worth
$10,000 per annum. "Civis" is urging the establishment of a turnpike
to the Missouri River.</p>

<p class="center">OREGON EMIGRANTS.</p>

<p>We have news from the Oregon emigrants up to the 3d of August,
at which time they left Fort Laramie. They expected to reach their
destination about the beginning of October. They were deficient in
breadstuffs and could not procure any at the fort without money. They
expected to obtain a supply at Buffalo, five or six days' journey from
the fort. Some fears were entertained that the Sioux Indians would
steal their stock, and otherwise give them trouble. Altogether they
appear to have got along very well, considering the unusual weather
they experienced between this and the Big Platte.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Independence Journal</i> of September 19, 1844, gives
Peter H. Burnett's letter, written from Linnton, Oregon,
July 25, 1844. [This letter was printed in the June
<span class="smcap">Quarterly</span>, 1903, pages 181-184 of this volume. It was
taken from the <i>Ohio Statesman</i>, which quoted it from the
<i>Washington Globe</i>.]</p>

<p>In the <i>Independence Journal</i>, September 19, 1844, under
the caption of "Independence: Its Trade and Prospects,"
the high state of prosperity of the town is spoken of.
Wagon makers are employed to build seventy-five wagons
for the Santa Fé traders by next spring, in place of only
fifty made the present year. Santa Fé road within the
State must be improved. United States Government
should give it a port of entry, and the State legislature
should locate a branch of State Bank there to accommodate
Santa Fé traders and commerce of western part of
State.</p>

From the <i>Independence Journal</i>, October 24, 1844.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilpin, of this place, who went out to Oregon about eighteen
months since, arrived on Tuesday last with several other persons.
They left Bent's Fort on the 22d of September. All was quiet and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
well at the fort, but there was a difficulty between the Santa Féans
and Eutaw Indians. The Spaniards had killed some Eutaws; and the
head chief and five other principal chiefs went to Santa Fé to receive
compensation. The Governor gave them what he could, or what he
thought was enough, and, refusing to give more, the head chief, in a
passion, pulled his beard, when he seized his sword and killed him and
another, and the guards, being called, fell upon the other four and
killed them. The Indians who accompanied them immediately left,
and killed, on their retreat, several Spaniards who were going from
Taos to Santa Fé. Altogether they had killed ten or twelve Spaniards.
A war between the Indians and Santa Féans, of course, was
expected. Some Spaniards, who were out on a buffalo hunt, met
Colonel Owens' company at the Cimmaron, and dispatched immediately
an express to Santa Fé. They made up a company at Santa
Fé, on receipt of the intelligence, among whom were Messrs. Chavis,
Armigo, and Percas, to escort him to Santa Fé; and brought out fresh
mules, and everything they would probably need. Colonel Owens
accompanied them to Santa Fé, where a ball was to be given him.
They met Charles Bent, Mr. Alvarez (our consul at Santa Fé), and Mr.
Ferguson, at Choteau's [Chouteau's] Island, about three days' travel
this side of Bent's Fort. Mr. St. Vrais [Vrain?] was this side of Corn
Creek with waggons, going on well. Doctor Connolly, with Lucas, was
between Ash Creek and Pawnee Fork, twenty-five miles ahead of Mr.
Speyers' company, which was near Walnut Creek. Mr. Speyers' mules
were poor and much worn out; they had left several on the road, beside
ten or fifteen lost shortly after they left Independence. All the teams
of Messrs. Bent and Connolly were in good order, and they were getting
along well.</p>

<p>We are indebted to a Spaniard, who accompanied Mr. Gilpin, for
the foregoing. We have not heard anything of particular importance
from Oregon. Mr. Gilpin brought a large number of letters, but we
have not, as yet, been favored with the perusal of any. The emigrants,
we understand, were generally getting along well.</p>

<p>The <i>Independence Journal</i>, October 31, 1844, under the
heading "Oregon and Colonel Polk," gives an extract
of a speech delivered by Colonel Polk in Congress on a
bill for extending jurisdiction of the laws of the United
States over all the people of Oregon Territory, and directing
officers of the Government to take possession of the
mouth of Columbia River, and establish a fort there.
This, it says, will show whether he (Polk) is for immediate
occupation of it or not; and that his opinions coincide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
with Mr. Clay's upon this subject. Gives an extract
of Polk's speech to substantiate its claim that Polk was
no more radical than Clay on this Oregon question.

<p class="center">LETTER FROM THE SANDWICH ISLANDS, OREGON, CALIFORNIA,
EMIGRATION, ETC.</p>

<p>We publish the subjoined letter, received by one of our citizens a
few days since, from a gentleman who accompanied the Oregon emigration
last year [1843]. We give it entire, that our readers may have
all the information that can be gathered from this section of the country.
It is not so favorable, in some respects, of the Oregon Territory, as the
accounts of others, but it is by no means disparaging. Mr. Gilpin
thinks that corn can be raised to advantage, and says that the reason
why they have none, is&mdash;because they plant none. It is undoubtedly
a fine country for all the small grains and is unsurpassed as a grazing
country. The emigrants who went out the past season have made a
great change in business, and money now circulates on the Columbia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
as well on this side of the mountains, and everything begins to assume
the appearance of civilization, business, trade, and the refinements
this side the mountains. We see that Mr. Cushing, our minister to
China, has returned by way of the city of Mexico; and here we have
a letter from one of our enterprising citizens from the <i>halfway house</i>&mdash;the
Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p>We have been in the habit of looking to Europe for Asiatic news;
let our government establish a chain of posts from this to Oregon, an
overland mail will speedily follow, and the China and East India trade
will pour into our channels of commerce from the gorges of the Rocky
Mountains: and a journey from New York to China, by way of Oregon,
will be less thought of than it formerly was to Saint Louis. The
Government should consider that a little enterprise will place the East
India trade at our door; and the sooner the better. We hope Congress,
this winter, will take active measures to bring about such a
state of things. What is a few thousand dollars compared with the
object to be acquired?</p>

<p class="left45"><span class="smcap">Lahiana, Maui</span>, Sandwich Islands, July 17, 1844.</p>

<p><i>J. Wells, Esq.</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: In a few days the first ship that has left this place for
the States, since my arrival here, will sail, and I take this opportunity
to tell you something of my journey and Oregon, etc., though probably
you have heard all the news long before you get this. I should
have written you ere this, had an opportunity offered. But to tell you
of the trip: I left the Shawnee mission on the 29th of May; our route
was through the Caw Indian country, which is good, has considerable
timber, and is well watered. It is a bad country for wagons to travel
through, having so many sloughs and bad creeks; the teams were
often stalled, and made very slow progress. We had three rivers and
creeks to cross before we reached the Platte River. The Platte River
has good grass&mdash;plenty of it&mdash;but is destitute of timber; here we saw
the first buffalo&mdash;they were poor and tough. We saw a few of the
Pawnee Indians. They are fine looking fellows, and no doubt, live
well on buffalo meat; they are quite treacherous. We reached the
crossing of Platte on the twenty-sixth day of July, a little more than
one month out. The traveling up the Platte is very good, level, and
hard. We struck from this to the north fork of the Platte, one day's
travel. On the 13th of July we arrived at the crossing of Laramie's
Fork, at the fort of the American Fur Company; before arriving here
we saw many splendid sights; also many of the dog towns that you
have heard of. I saw quantities of the dogs; they are small, round
animals, the size of a cat. Certain it is that there are owls that visit
them, also rattlesnakes, but for what reason is a matter of dispute.
After we left Laramie we came to the Black Hills, the worst of all
traveling,&mdash;hilly, sandy, and full of wild sage&mdash;'tis death on a wagon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
The country is all of this barren, sandy kind, until we reach Fort Hall
and destitute of timber. Arrived at Fort Hall the 13th of September,
after experiencing some cold rains, snow, hail, etc. At Fort
Hall we could get no provisions, and were obliged to go down the river
(Snake), and depend on getting fish to subsist on; this was the reason
of my going to Oregon instead of California. The country down
Snake River is hilly, rocky, sandy, no timber, but an abundance of
sage, until we get to the Blue Mountains; here is plenty of pine, the
country very broken, and bad traveling, though the wagons went
through. After getting through the Blue Mountains we came to a
splendid country of grass, where there were thousands of Indian
horses grazing. About twenty miles from this, we come to the
Walla Walla Valley. There is a missionary establishment here.
They raise grain and vegetables, but no timber, except for firewood.
About twenty miles from this we came to the Columbia River. Many
of the emigrants sold their cattle here, and went down the river by
water, as they could not cross the Cascade mountains with their
wagons, though they could go down one hundred miles farther and
then take water, as many did. The country on the Columbia is only
fit for grazing, being good grass, but sandy soil. On the 3d of November
arrived at Fort Vancouver, just as the rainy season had commenced;
and it was very disagreeable and rained most of the time I
was there. I then went to the Willamette Falls; quite a town here&mdash;forty
houses, four stores, two sawmills, one flour mill, and another to
be erected soon. This country is not capable of half as large a settlement
as people represent; there is much timber, and it can not be
cleared in many years, so as to be capable of great production; and
what prairie there is will not produce as much as your land; but the
wheat is better. Neither do many think the soil will last long, but
that it is rather shallow; and there is much fever and ague. Besides,
the winters are so wet 'tis impossible to do much out of doors. It has
the advantage that grain (wheat) is worth eighty cents per bushel, and
cattle will winter themselves. Take it all in all, 'tis nothing like your
country.</p>

<p>After my arrival there, finding that I could not get to California
until spring, I concluded to take a vessel for the Sandwich Islands,
and then go from here to California, so I concluded to stay. It [this]
is a fine climate&mdash;a perpetual summer, and little rain. The natives
require but little clothing, and, in fact, some of them do not wear any.</p>

<p>I hardly know what to write about Oregon, or what you would like
to know; though if I was where you are, and should see some one
from Oregon, I could ask him a hundred questions, as you could me.
The report of Wilkes that you had is very correct. There are thousands
of salmon here [Oregon]&mdash;some wild game, plenty of ducks, geese,
and swans, and some good wet places to raise more of them&mdash;as there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
must be some wet places, being so much rain in the winter, and no
snow.</p>

<p>There is scarcely any corn raised&mdash;it will not do well. I saw a
little, but it was poor. Most other kinds of grains do well. There is
no money in Oregon; although most of those who have been farming
a few years have made property, as grain is high and cattle take care
of themselves, and sell high. Oxen are worth $75 to $125 per yoke;
beef, six cents per pound. Many of the people who went to California
have left it and gone to Oregon. I saw many of them while there, and
they gave as one of the reasons of leaving&mdash;trouble with the Spaniards.</p>

<p>
Truly yours,<br />

<p class="center">THE OREGON.</p>

<p>The editor of the <i>New York Commercial</i> has read letters from the
Oregon Territory, brought overland and mailed at the extreme western
frontier of the United States. They are as late as June 17th, from
the Methodist missionary station at Willamette. The Rev. Mr. Gary,
who was sent out by that missionary society, had arrived at Willamette
<i>via</i> the Sandwich Islands, himself and wife in good health. Mr. Gary
had been but a short time in Oregon when an opportunity offered of
sending a communication to the Board of Missions by a small party
who were about to return to the United States. He had, however,
seen all the mission family, except Rev. Mr. Perkins, who was at a
distant post. The missionaries and their families were in good health
at the date above mentioned. No event of special interest regarding
the mission had taken place since last previous advices. Mr. Gary
concurs, with several missionaries who have returned from that far
country, in the opinion that the natives are a degraded race of beings,
and that there is little prospect of doing them permanent good by any
ministerial labor which may be expended among them.</p>

<p>Congress may provide for the occupation of it&mdash;for the formation

road across the mountains, and encourage emigration in every possible
manner, and the whole will not contribute so much towards its settlement
as the negotiations of a treaty with China, opening to us a market
for our products in that country. If the one now before Congress has
done so, Great Britain may set her claim to the Columbia&mdash;it will be
a claim for but a short time. Our shipping, farmers, merchants, and
tradesmen will soon find a road to a country possessing the advantages
the west side of the American continent would possess, in that event,

American skill and industry, from the mouth of the Columbia, with

<p>The <i>Weston Journal</i>, March 1, 1845, under heading,

lying west of the Missouri River south of the forty-ninth
degree of north latitude and east of the Rocky Mountains,
and north of the boundary line between the United States
and Texas, not included within the limits of any State,

<p class="center">RAILROAD TO OREGON.</p>

<p>The <i>Philadelphia Ledger's</i> Washington correspondent says that Mr.
Whitney, of New York, contemplates the construction of a railroad
from the western shore of Lake Michigan, in a direct line through to
the Columbia River, covering the distance of some 2,100 miles, which
shall be the point of debarkation to China.</p>

<p>The cost of the road, when completed, is estimated at fifty millions
of dollars, and twenty-five years would be required to perfect the
scheme. Eight days would be about the traveling time from New
York City to the terminus of the road, and if [steamship?] facilities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
were employed, some twenty-five more would convey one to Amoy, in
China, so that by this short cut, a journey across the globe might be
accomplished within the narrow limit of a single month.</p>

<p>By the establishment of this means of communication, we should be
enabled to command the Chinese market, and to extend our commerce
with South America, Mexico, India, and other parts.</p>

<p>And, in addition to the vast results that would necessarily ensue from
this work by the force of circumstances, we should secure the transportation
of the English trade on account of the great shortening of time.</p>

<p>All the coöperation and assistance that Mr. Whitney asks the government
is a grant of sixty miles wide of the public land, from one
terminus of the contemplated road to the other, for which a full consideration
would be given in carrying the mails, and transporting ammunition
stores, soldiers, and all public matters free of cost.</p>

<p>Preparations are making on the whole frontier, by the Oregon emigrants,
to leave at an early day. One company goes from Savannah,
another from some point between that and this, and the company from
this county, we understand, will leave at Fort Leavenworth, or its
neighborhood. One of the emigrants who goes with the Savannah
company informs us that not less than one hundred families will leave
at Elizabethtown, and thirty families from the other points. The
number from this county we do not know. * * * A committee has
submitted some rules and regulations for the intending emigrants.
They have not yet had a meeting to adopt them, but they no doubt
will do so. They go about it in the right way, and the rules and regulations
are such as to secure order and method. They expect to leave
about the first of April, if the grass is sufficient, or as soon thereafter

<p class="center">LETTER FROM OREGON.</p>

<p>The following extracts from a letter written by one of the emigrants
of 1843, will be particularly interesting at this time, and should be
carefully read by those going out this spring. It will be particularly
useful to emigrants who leave from this part of the country:</p>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">Fort Vancouver</span>, November 11, 1843.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: We were six months to-day, from the time we left home,
in getting to this place, though we might have arrived one month
sooner had we not unnecessarily wasted time on the way. To give
you a full description of our travels would occupy more time than I
have to spare. I will, however, give you and my friends a short
sketch. We left Westport on the 27th of May, and crossed the Kansas
River near the old village: thence up the north side of the Kansas,
where we had a great deal of rain and stormy weather to encounter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
which made it very disagreeable traveling. We then crossed over [to]
the Platte, about eighty miles above the Pawnee village; thence up
the Platte about fifty miles above the forks, where we crossed the
South Fork. We then struck over on to the North Fork and traveled
up it until we came to Fort Laramie. We then crossed Laramie's
Fork of Platte, which we found very difficult to pass. We still kept
up the North Fork to within forty miles of the Rocky Mountains,
where we crossed it. We came to a small stream, called Sweetwater,
one of the streams of the northern branch of Platte; we traveled up
this until we passed through the Rocky Mountains, which we found to
be as good as any part of our road. We then came to the waters of
Green River, which is one of the branches of the Colorado&mdash;then to
Fort Bridges [Bridger], which is on the waters of Green River; from
there we next struck Bear River, which empties into the Great Salt
Lake. We traveled several days down this river, then crossed over on
to the Snake River, and arrived at Fort Hall on the 25th day of August.
Here I found some of the best beef I ever saw. From here we traveled
down Snake or Lewis River, crossing and recrossing the same to Fort
Bosie [Boisé]; thence to Fort Walla Walla, crossing the Blue Mountains
in our route. We passed them much easier than I expected.</p>

<p>At Walla Walla myself and Reeves, and many others of the emigrants,
exchanged cattle [for cattle] at Vancouver. We got age for
age and sex for sex. Here we found it advisable to take [to the] water
and travel down the great Columbia, which we did with some difficulty.
Those who did not exchange their stock went to the Methodist mission
at the foot of the Cascade Mountains. Here they carried their wagons
by water and drove their stock through by land. A large portion of
the emigrants have arrived, and the remainder will be here in a few
days. Those who have been to the Willamette Valley say it is a rich
and beautiful country, but to what extent they know not, as they have
not had sufficient time to examine it. I find any quantity of provisions
can be had here. Doctor McLoughlin, of Vancouver, has rendered great
assistance to the emigrants in loaning them his boats and furnishing
them with provisions to take back to the companies that are yet behind&mdash;at
the same time refusing any compensation for either. We have
found the Hudson Bay Company at all the forts very accommodating.
The road from Independence to Fort Hall is as good a road as I would
wish to travel,&mdash;from Fort Hall there is some bad road and some good.
The reason why we did not try to take our wagons across the Cascade
Mountains was that the season had so far advanced it was thought to
be a dangerous undertaking through so much snow and cold weather.
We will prepare a road across these mountains next summer, so that
the next emigration can bring their wagons through without any difficulty.
Some of us will meet the next emigration at Fort Hall.</p>

<p>I will now give you a description of the necessary outfit each person
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
should have to come to this terrestrial paradise. Your wagons should
be light, yet substantial and strong, and a plenty of good oxen.
Though I wrote while on the Sweetwater that mule teams were preferable,
but after seeing them thoroughly tried I have become convinced
that oxen are more preferable&mdash;they are the least trouble and
stand traveling much the best&mdash;are worth a great deal more when
here. Load your wagons light and put one third more team to them
than is necessary to pull the load. Bring nothing with you except
provisions and a plenty of clothes to do you one year from the time
you leave. They can all be had on as good terms here as in Missouri,
and even better; bring but few bedclothes, for they will be worn out
when they arrive here&mdash;they can be had here on good terms. Your
oxen will not require shoeing. Bring a plenty of loose cattle, cows
and heifers particularly, as they are but little trouble and are worth a
great deal. Bring mules to drive your loose stock. Bring a few good
American mares, but use them very tenderly or you will not get them
here. American horses are worth considerable in this country. Horses
can not get here except they are well used, and you should have two
or three pairs of shoes and nails for them and your mules. You should
bring 200 pounds of flour, 100 pounds of bacon, for every member of
the family that can eat, besides other provisions. Make no calculation
on getting buffalo or other wild meat, for you are only wasting time
and killing horses and mules to get it. Have your wagon beds made
in such a manner that they can be used for boats; you will find them
of great service in crossing streams&mdash;have your wagons well covered,
so that they will not leak, or your provisions and clothes will spoil.
Have your tents made water tight; start as early as possible; let your
teams and stock all be in good order. Start as soon as your stock can
get grass enough to travel on, for the grass will be getting better every
day until you arrive at Fort Hall; after that you will find the grass
bad in places until you get to the Blue Mountains. You will find
plenty of grass from there to the Willamette Valley. Our cattle are
in better order than they were one month ago. Large flintlock guns
are good to traffic with the Snake Indians. Bring a plenty of cheap
cotton shirts to trade to the Indians on this side of the mountains.
You might start with calves and kill them on the way, before they get
poor, for fresh eating. You will find some beans, rice, and dried fruit
of great use on the road. You should travel in companies of forty
wagons, and continue together the whole route. You will find some
ship biscuit to be of great use at times when you can not find fuel sufficient
to cook with.</p>

<p>Be sure and bring nothing except what will be of material use to
you on your journey, for, depend upon it, if you overload you will lose
your team, wagon, and goods. You will find good stout young cows to
answer in place of oxen, in case you should not have sufficient; let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
them be about middle size; let them be good, sound oxen, that have
never been injured. I am satisfied from the products of the country
that a man can live easier here than he can in any part of the United
States. If he raises any produce he is sure of getting a good price for
it in anything he may call for, money excepted. There is very little
money in this country, though it is very little use when a man can get
anything he wants without it. The merchants here will sell their
goods cheaper for produce or labor than they will for cash, because
they make a profit on the commodities they purchase, while there is
no profit on cash. In fact, business is done here altogether by exchanging
commodities. We can purchase anything of the Hudson
Bay Company cheaper by promising wheat next year than we can for
cash in hand. Cows are worth (that is, American,) from $30 to $50;
American horses from $60 to $100; oxen $60 to $80; wheat $1 per
bushel; oats, 40 cents; potatoes, 40 cents; peas the same; beef, 6 cents;
pork, 10 cents; butter, 20 cents; common labor, $1.50; mechanics, $2
to $3.</p>

<p>The next emigration will get their cattle and wagons through quite
easy, if they will start early and travel constantly though slow; they
must not push.</p>

<p>Persons on the north side of the Missouri should rendezvous on the
south side of the river, opposite the Blacksnake Hills, and go up the
Nemaha and strike the Platte near the Pawnee village; by so doing
they will avoid crossing the Kansas, and avoid some bad roads, and go
100 miles nearer.</p>

<p>We were not troubled with the Indians in the dangerous part of the
country, for this reason, I have no doubt,&mdash;we kept a strong guard in
nighttime and a sharp lookout in daytime. After we passed Green
River we abandoned guarding and broke up into small companies,
though advised to the contrary, and in passing from the Blue Mountains
to the valley some of the emigrants were imposed on, in fact,
some of them were robbed, though it was their own fault for not
sticking together. You should start with some medicine, for you will
have more or less sickness until you get to Fort Hall. Be sure and take
good care not to expose yourself unnecessarily, for people have to go
through a seasoning on the road, which makes the most of them sick.
We are now eating apples which grew at Vancouver. They are now
gathering their apples, peaches, and grapes, etc.; these are the only
fruits tried as yet; they are fine.</p>

<p>The missionaries here have done more toward Christianizing the
Indians in five years than has been done in the States in twenty years.
Numbers of them who can not speak one word of English hold regular
family worship. They are members of the Methodist Episcopal church.
I am convinced it is in consequence of not being able to get liquor.
The Hudson Bay Company and missionaries and settlers have taken a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
bold stand against the introduction of ardent spirits into this country,
and I am convinced while they continue this praiseworthy course we
all will see more satisfaction and pleasure, and our little colony will
profit thereby.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Editor</span>: I desire to recommend, through your paper, to all emigrants
to Oregon, to pass by the Council Bluffs. The road from Weston
to the Bluffs is now in fine order. All the streams are bridged or have
ferries, so that there is no obstacle to cause an hour's detention until
the company shall reach the Bluffs. The best route is that crossing
the Nishnebatona at Huntseeker's Ferry; thence by the residence of
Major Stephen Cooper to Port au Poule, where a good ferry-boat is
now in preparation to cross the Missouri. From the Missouri, at that
point, to the Pawnee villages, the road is much better than on the
lower route, and the distance is about the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Editor</span>: I wish to give notice, through your paper, to all those
parties who intend to emigrate to Oregon, that arrangements have
been made to cross the Missouri River at two different points, the one
in Andrew, the other in Buchanan County. Some of the citizens of
Andrew have made an arrangement with the Sacs Indians for the privilege
of range, wood, and water, opposite Elizabethtown.</p>

<p>They have promised the Indians six two-year-old beeves, to be paid
by that portion of the Oregon company which may cross at Elizabethtown.
This point is very suitable for crossing the Missouri River.
The rates of only about half what is usual at the common ferries on
the Missouri.</p>

<p>The company expect to rendezvous in the Indian country, opposite
Elizabethtown, between the first and tenth of April. A number of
excellent citizens expect to cross at this place. This is the point from
which a portion of the Oregon company started last spring. Taking
all things into consideration, this is probably the best route to cross
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
the Missouri at Elizabethtown (where there is an excellent large, new
ferry-boat), and fall over on the Platte, opposite the Pawnee village,
and thence pass along up the south side of the Platte River.</p>

<h3>THE ORIGIN AND AUTHORSHIP OF THE
BANCROFT PACIFIC STATES PUBLICATIONS:
A HISTORY OF
A HISTORY.&mdash;I.</h3>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">William Alfred Morris</span>.</p>

<p>The true student of history, when confronted for the
first time with a statement of what purports to be an
historical fact, weighs at the outset, as all-important, the
evidence of its accuracy. If there be at hand no means
of verifying the statement, the only ground of assurance
is a knowledge of who is speaking, how likely he is to
know the truth, and how well fitted he is to tell it; for
to be a writer of accurate history one must not only know
facts, but must also be truthful, and so far above bias
upon his subject as to be able to treat it fairly, openly,
and without false coloring of any part. It is therefore
the first canon of historical criticism to accept as authority
no statement unless it be known who is making that
statement.</p>

<p>The greater our interest in a given subject, the more
important to us becomes the question of the authority for
all statements concerning that subject. As the field of
history is narrowed down to a single state or to a single
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
locality, where every man may to a certain extent be an
historian, an anonymous written account, though excellent
in itself, will still be viewed with suspicion. The
fact that there is a good local knowledge of the subject by no
means removes the necessity of determining authorship.</p>

<p>Fortunate it is for the Pacific States and Territories of
the United States that data concerning their history from
its beginning were collected during the lifetime of men
who laid the foundations of these commonwealths. It is
then a matter of the highest importance to the people of
this vast empire to know who wove this material together,
and wrote the only attempt at a full and connected history
of the Pacific Coast which has ever been published.</p>

<p>The completion of the Bancroft series of Pacific Slope
histories, to which reference is here made, marks an
event unique in the annals of history writing. At no
other time and in no other land has there been carried to
completion a work of like character and magnitude. There
had previously been written a few histories of Oregon
and California covering a certain period, and designed
chiefly to give a treatment of a certain institution or political
subject, but so far as the thorough working up of
the whole ground was concerned, a virgin field presented
itself.</p>

<p>Moreover, the undertaking was an unusually inspiring
one. It was none other than that of tracing from the days
when Europeans first trod the Pacific shores of America the
sequence of events by which these lands were acquired
and occupied by their present holders, political governments
organized, and the development of resources entered
upon; in short, it was the following up of the successive
steps by which the institutions and industries of
a nineteenth century civilization were established in a
western wilderness. When we remember that the greater
part of this record could at the time of writing be made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
from information furnished directly by the men who
made this history, and that the lack of material which
so often embarrasses the writer could not here be a cause
of complaint, we may well conclude that such an opportunity
had never before fallen to the lot of the historian.</p>

<p>Again, in the vast collection of historical sources into
one place, as well as in the newness of the field and inspiring
nature of the work, the undertaking presents a
most remarkable feature. The projector of this enterprise
was the first on the coast to undertake such a collection
on a large scale. This fact, together with the recency
of many of the events, which both rendered an
unending number of eye-witnesses easily accessible for
procuring personal narratives, and likewise caused those
who possessed papers and books throwing light upon
history, to set slight value upon them, enabled Mr. Bancroft
to collect a library of material such as on the beginning
and early chapters of Pacific Coast history in all
probability can never again be equalled.</p>

<p>Finally, in the amount of material which it presents,
and in the extent of ground which it covers, the Bancroft
series has attained epoch-making proportions. So closely
related is the history of the Pacific states and territories
of the United States to that of the regions north and south,
that to insure a complete understanding of it required the
writing also of the History of Mexico, Texas, and Central
America, as well as that of British Columbia and Alaska.
When we learn that two thousand different authorities
were consulted in writing the History of Central America,
and ten thousand in arranging the material for the History
of Mexico; that in taking out material for the History
of California eight men were employed for six years;
and that in merely indexing the material for the History
of Mexico five men worked ten years, we are inclined to
quote approvingly these words of Mr. Bancroft:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span></p>

<p>"I say, then, without unpardonable boasting, that in
my opinion there never in the history of literature was
performed so consummate a feat as the gathering, abstracting,
and arranging of the material for this History
of the Pacific States": (Bancroft's Literary Industries,
581).</p>

<p>The history of no American locality would be considered
without some account of its aborigines. The result,
then, of this Bancroft plan has been the writing of the
History of the Pacific slope of the continent from Bering
Sea to Darien, with a History of the Native Races in five
volumes as an introduction, and a half dozen volumes of
sketches and essays by way of conclusion, in all thirty-nine
octavo volumes.</p>

<p>But this work, the greatest of the kind, few if any of
whose separate divisions have been superseded by later
works has suffered greatly in the estimation of historians
because they do not know who is authority for the statements
contained in them. Justice to the people of any
state or territory whose history appears in this series demands
that they should know in whose words it is related.
A compliance with the reasonable expectations of the pioneers
who contributed books, narrations, and documents
to aid in the preparation of a standard history of their respective
states calls for a public knowledge of the identity
of the writer to the end that the volume in which their
chief interest centers be not stigmatized as anonymous.
And above all, a conformity with usage, not to mention
an observance of the principles of right, requires that the
author of finished work published in this series, or any
other, should receive public acknowledgment of his labors
and whatever of praise or blame is his due.</p>

<p>Ten years ago it was shown in the California press
that the Bancroft histories are not the works of the man
who claims to be their author. But to say that "The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Works of Hubert Howe Bancroft" were written by any
person other than Hubert Howe Bancroft is such a contradiction
as to startle today the great majority both
East and West whose attention have never been directed
to the question. To determine the authorship of a work
we are wont to consult its title page, and the title pages
of these volumes all declare that they are "By Hubert
Howe Bancroft." The advertising matter sent out by
the Bancroft publishing establishment refers to them as
"the writings of Mr. Bancroft," with never a suggestion
that any other person wrote a line. The same course was
followed in the reviews of these volumes, which at the
time of their publication were scattered by the press
throughout the length and breadth of the leading countries
of Europe, as well as in our land, although here
we must remember that book reviews may be but another
name for advertising matter prepared by the publisher
and inserted at advertising rates. In his Literary Industries,
the volume giving an account of his literary activities,
Mr. Bancroft refers to himself as the author (Lit. Ind.,
361, 661), and speaks of his own writing without a clear
reference to that of others (Lit. Ind., 288, 568, 571, 653)
in such terms as to give the impression that he was the
only writer who prepared the manuscript as it went to
the printer. True, he mentions assistants, and we can
easily see, as he tells us, that he must have had fifteen
or twenty note takers, cataloguers, and other library aids
(Lit. Ind., 582) in order to arrange so vast an amount of
material. When assistants are mentioned it is usually in
words which justify the reader in the inference that these
aids are meant (see Central America I, preface, viii; Literary
Industries, 584), and that, therefore, the assistants
are in no sense authors.</p>

<p>By a careful reading of the Literary Industries, however,
we find that there was a class of assistants who are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
differentiated from ordinary library aids, by the statement
that they were "more experienced and able," and
whose work Mr. Bancroft describes as "the study and
reduction of certain minor sections of the history which
I employed in my writing after more or less condensation
and change": (Lit. Ind., 568). But even this passage
seems to indicate that the material prepared by these
writers was rewritten by Mr. Bancroft.</p>

<p>As a result, therefore, of the indication of the title
page of these works, of the recognition of the public
press, of the statements of the Literary Industries, and of
Mr. Bancroft's connection with the work widely known
through personal means, it happens that today he is
called the "Historian of the Pacific Coast." Furthermore,
he is the only person to whom such a title is given,
being so recognized by newspapers, encyclopedias, and
the people at large. In the minds of the great number,
Hubert Howe Bancroft is the historian of the Pacific
states for just the same reason that George Bancroft is
the historian of the United States. Speaking in accord
with this popular estimate of Mr. Bancroft's work, Wendell
Phillips once called him "The Macaulay of the
West."</p>

<p>Nowhere, however, can there be found a statement by
this historian in which he lays an unequivocal claim to
the authorship of the works which have been published
under his name. By his own words quoted above he admits
that the work was, at least in part, coöperative, and
that he was a compiler of the work of his assistants. And
for any one man to assert authorship of the Bancroft
series of histories would be preposterous. According to
actual computation, the mere work of arranging the material
and writing the History of the Pacific States, after
a small army of note-takers had concluded their operations,
represents an equivalent to the labors of one man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
for a hundred years: (Frances Fuller Victor in <i>Salt Lake
Tribune</i>, April 14, 1893.) Moreover, the use of quotations
from foreign languages, of which Mr. Bancroft had
no knowledge, proves that parts of the work are not from
his pen, while the different literary styles (see for example,
the review of Oregon I in the <i>New York Tribune</i>,
Nov. 26, 1886; in the <i>S. F. Argonaut</i>, Oct. 23, 1886; in
the <i>Sacramento D. Record-Union</i>, Oct. 27, 1886; and in the
<i>Portland Oregonian</i>, Oct. 28, 1886), and varying degrees
of historical workmanship (Compare reviews of Oregon
II in <i>N. Y. Tribune</i>, January, 1887; and in <i>S. F. Chronicle</i>,
Jan. 13, 1887, with reviews of other Bancroft works)
clearly reveal the work of a number of writers.</p>

<p>A little knowledge on this point has proved a dangerous
thing for the reputation of the histories. Some of
the newspapers of the coast have learned that Mr. Bancroft
did not do all the writing and have even published
the names of other authors of the series with statements
more or less conjectural as to the writing done by
them. In some cases, wild speculations as to the authorship
of the works have been published. Many are under
the impression that those who went about taking statements
of pioneers and in other ways collecting material
were themselves writing the manuscript which was published,
and that consequently much of the history is no
more critically written than an ordinary newspaper article,
and as little known about its authorship. Furthermore,
it is believed in some quarters that those who prepared
narrations for Mr. Bancroft were writing history
for him to publish, and that persons not connected with
the Bancroft library were authors of parts of the work.
In accordance with this idea, it has been claimed that a
certain tone favorable to the Mormons which runs
through the History of Utah is to be accounted for by
the theory that the volume was written by some one connected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
with the Mormon church, whereas the truth is
that, although the historian of that church prepared some
data for Mr. Bancroft's use, the work was prepared in
the library by Mr. Bancroft and one of his assistants
from the annals in his possession (Frances Fuller Victor
in <i>Salt Lake Tribune</i>, April 14, 1893).</p>

<p>In some instances, the histories have lost standing because
of the assumption that Mr. Bancroft was their
author. Thus statements in the History of California
supposed to be, but now known not to be from his pen,
have been singled out as reckless, and argument has been
made upon the principle "false in one thing, false in
all," that the seven whole volumes of California history
are unworthy of credence (pamphlet proceedings of the
Society of California Pioneers in reference to the histories
of Hubert Howe Bancroft, page 10). Following this
lead an attempt has been made to discredit Bancroft's
Oregon on the ground that his California is said to be
unreliable.</p>

<p>Had Mr. Bancroft made public the fact that three persons
besides himself wrote the History of California, that
he was in reality the author of but sixty pages in the entire
seven volumes of that set, that he had not the least
claim to the authorship of the History of Oregon, and
that the histories of the two states were in the main
written by different persons, the fallacy of this argument
would have been clear, estimates of the collections of
matter in these volumes would have been made on their
own intrinsic merit, and their value would not have been
impaired by false assumptions concerning their authorship.</p>

<p>A third result of this neglect of Mr. Bancroft to make
public acknowledgment of the extent of the writings of
his assistants has been the accusation "that he is a purloiner
of other peoples' brains," (<i>Salt Lake Tribune</i>, Feb.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
16, 1893) and that he has made a reputation as an author
at the expense of his assistants. Concerning this charge,
the most remarkable ever made in the annals of American
historical writing, the reader must be the judge after
weighing all the facts.</p>

<p>The writer's apology for this article is his desire to
give such facts as he has in the hope that they will do
something to clear up mistaken ideas concerning the
authorship of these histories, that they may aid somewhat
in forming a correct estimate of the series, and that they
may secure for the other authors as well as for Mr. Bancroft
whatever credit is rightfully theirs. To these ends
it is to be hoped that those who have any additional facts
will make them public. The late Frances Fuller Victor,
one of the Bancroft corps of writers, had long collected
material on the authorship of the histories. In preparing
this paper, the writer has depended largely upon information
furnished by her correspondence and papers,
and by explanations given by her in conversation.</p>

<p>The statement of Mr. Bancroft in the Literary Industries
to the effect that his "assistants" merely wrote up
minor topics which he then used in his own writing, must
be taken as applying to the work as projected rather than
as actually carried out. In a letter written in 1878 before
the final division of labor was made, Mr. Bancroft
said, "When all the material I have is gone over and
notes taken according to the general plan, I shall give
one person one thing or one part to write, and another
person another part": (Letter to Mrs. Victor of August
1, 1878.) Here, it will be observed, the plan is for the
"assistants" to do the actual work of writing history and
not to prepare material for their chief to use in his writing.
And it will shortly appear that it was the "assistants"
who wrote the work and Mr. Bancroft who wrote
the minor parts. To understand why the intended order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
was thus reversed, it is necessary to study the growth of
the history project and to enter into the steps through
which it was evolved.</p>

<p>Hubert Howe Bancroft, with whose name these works
are linked, and who has been widely credited as their
author, is a native of Granville, Ohio, where he was born
May 5, 1832, a descendent of old New England families
through both the paternal and maternal lines. In his
own account of his life (Literary Industries, 47-244),
he tells us that when but three years old he could read
the New Testament without having to spell many of the
words. At the school age, however, he found it difficult
to learn, and after a winter at the brick schoolhouse under
the tutelage of a brother of his mother, the latter became
satisfied that he was not treated judiciously and fairly
took him out of school.</p>

<p>A sister had married George H. Derby, a bookseller of
Geneva, New York, subsequently of Buffalo, and at about
the age of fifteen, the boy was offered the choice of preparing
for college or entering the Buffalo bookstore. He
at first chose the former course and spent a year in the
academy of his town, but becoming discouraged in his
study, entered the employ of Derby in August, 1848.
Discharged from the store in six months, he returned to
Ohio and acted as a sales agent for his brother-in-law's
goods with such success that he was invited back to the
store and became a clerk with the beginning of the year
1850. His father, influenced by the gold excitement,
decided to go to California in February of that year, and
with George L. Kenny, his closest friend, he was sent by
Derby to handle books in the land of gold, setting out in
December, 1851.</p>

<p>After their arrival in San Francisco, Sacramento was
determined upon as a place of business, and young Bancroft
worked in the mines until arrangements could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
made with his brother-in-law. But Derby's death in the
meantime ended the plan, and in 1853, he set out to try
his fortune at the newly-boomed mining town of Crescent
City. Here he was employed as bookkeeper and bookseller,
and made six or eight thousand dollars, most of
which he subsequently lost through investing in Crescent
City property. In 1855, Mr. Bancroft made a visit to his
old home in the East, and his sister, in return for his
assistance in recovering the amount of Derby's California
investment, let him have the sum, amounting to $5,500,
with which to begin business. Obtaining credit in New
York he shipped a ten thousand dollar stock of goods for
San Francisco, and with Kenny organized the firm of
H. H. Bancroft and Company about December 1, 1856.</p>

<p>From the first, Mr. Bancroft tells us, he had a taste for
publishing, and it was but three years until the inception
of what grew into the historical project. In 1859, Wm. H.
Knight, manager of the Bancroft publishing department,
while employed in preparing the Hand Book Almanac
for the next year, asked for the books necessary to carry
on the work. It occurred to the head of the firm that he
would again have occasion to refer to books on the coast
states, and he accordingly transferred to Mr. Knight a
copy of each of the fifty or seventy-five books in stock
that had reference to the country. Later he added to the
number by purchases in second-hand stores, and when in
the East secured from the bookstores of New York, Boston,
and Philadelphia, volumes which fell under his observation.
By 1862, he had a thousand volumes, and
upon a visit to London and Paris in that year, learned
that much more remained to be done. In 1866, he started
on a search throughout Europe, which resulted in increasing
his collection to ten thousand volumes. As to the
field covered by these works, he says:</p>

<p>"Gradually and almost imperceptibly had the area of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
my efforts enlarged. From Oregon it was but a step to
British Columbia and Alaska; and as I was obliged from
California to go to Mexico and Spain, it finally became
settled in my mind to make the western half of North
America my field": (Lit. Ind. 180). He now began the
collection of Mexican works and the purchase of private
libraries in the United States. In 1869, after ten years'
collecting, the library numbered sixteen thousand volumes,
about half of which were pamphlets. In May of
the next year, these were placed on one floor of the Bancroft
building on Market Street, and a young New Englander
named Henry L. Oak, lately editor of a religious
journal published by the firm, was installed as librarian.</p>

<p>(The main facts of Oak's life, as learned by Mrs. Victor,
are as follows: Henry Labbeus Oak was born at Garland,
Maine, in 1844. His ancestry&mdash;including the
family names of Oak, Merriam, Hastings, Hill, and
Smith&mdash;was entirely American from a period preceding
the Revolutionary War, being originally English and
Welsh. He was educated at the public and private
schools of his native town until, in 1861, he entered
Bowdoin College, and was graduated at Dartmouth in
the class of 1865. During his college course, he taught
in the public and high schools of different towns in
Maine; and after graduation, for a year in an academy
at Morristown, New Jersey.</p>

<p>Mr. Oak came to California by steamer in 1866, and,
after some attempts at commercial life, broken by a long
illness, again became a teacher. A year was spent as
principal of the public school at Haywards, and as instructor
in the collegiate institute at Napa, and in the
spring of 1868, he became office editor of the <i>Occident</i>, a
Presbyterian paper which the Bancroft house was then
publishing for an association. According to Mr. Bancroft
(Lit. Ind. 219), "the whole burden of the journal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
gradually fell on him." But when, owing to a disagreement
with the religious association, the firm declined to
publish the paper any longer, the young editor was left
without employment. In the meantime a somewhat
erratic Englishman named Bosquetti had succeeded
Knight as custodian of the Bancroft library, and Oak
was appointed to assist him. Upon his decamping a few
months later, at the end of 1868, Mr. Oak was appointed
to the position.)</p>

<p>The beginning of a classification of the material in the
library had been made by Mr. Knight, who saved clippings
and arranged them in scrap-books and boxes. It
now became Oak's duty to superintend the extraction of
material from the volumes in his custody and to catalogue
new books as they came in. In May, 1871, he prepared
for publication by the firm, two guide-books for tourists.
It was at the same time that Mr. Bancroft took another
step toward the history plan.</p>

<p>The plan of publishing a Pacific Coast encyclopedia
had been under consideration for a year or two, and was
now adopted. Mr. Bancroft began to look for contributors.
John S. Hittell, publisher of the Commerce and
Industries of the Pacific Coast, prepared a list of the
principal subjects to be treated, and Oak began to gather
statements from pioneers and contributors of every sort
by issuing circulars and writing letters. For about a
year the preparations continued. During the first half
of 1872 Ora Oak, a younger brother of the librarian,
together with others, extracted material on Pacific Coast
voyages and travels. Walter M. Fisher, an educated
young Englishman who came to the library early in the
year, wrote out such travels as those of Bryant, Bayard
Taylor, and Humboldt. The librarian, finding inadequate
the system of indexing the library then in use, set
to work to devise a more practical one, and spent three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
months in bringing it to perfection. This was apparently
the only part of the year's work which proved
abiding.</p>

<p>That the material in the Bancroft library was better
adapted to the preparation of a history than of an encyclopedia
gradually appeared to those who came in contact
with it. (Walter M. Fisher was born in Ulster in 1849,
and was the son of a Presbyterian clergyman, a member
of an English and Scotch colony. He was educated at
Queen's College, Belfast. Nemos remembered him as
"a handsome fellow, a great eater, and a hard worker."
Together with Harcourt, he left Bancroft's employ in
1874 to accept the editorship of the <i>Overland Monthly</i>.
Returning to London in 1875, he published a clever work
entitled the <i>Californians</i>. Subsequently he became a
physician). After several years of suggestion, discussion,
and change, Mr. Bancroft decided to reshape the
entire plan of work accordingly. The history of the Pacific
slope of the continent was to be written, beginning
at the Isthmus of Panama with the first appearance of
the Spaniards, and then taking up the successive regions
to the north as their history had its beginning. This
work, embracing an account of all the various republics,
provinces, states, and territories along the Pacific, it was
decided to designate as The History of the Pacific States.</p>

<p>Heretofore, Mr. Bancroft had been known only as
bookseller and publisher, and manager of one of San
Francisco's large business houses. His experience in
writing had been limited to the preparation of some material
for the proposed encyclopedia. But now, when he
had reached the age of forty years, practically all of
them except the first sixteen, spent in the world of business,
the head of the firm of H. H. Bancroft and Company
made his first venture as a literary man, writing
himself and rewriting the work of others. He began by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
preparing what he considered a suitable introduction to
the history. The task was not easy, especially for one
unaccustomed to write. In fourteen weeks he had taken
out material from which he wrote three hundred pages
of introduction to the History of Central America which
he subsequently reduced to seventy-five pages. This
seems to have been the only part of the work that he considered
as exclusively his own theme: (Lit. Ind., 291).
But this matter subsequently had to be rewritten.</p>

<p>While writing on this volume, Mr. Bancroft became
convinced that the history could not be complete without
an account of the original inhabitants of the coast. To
quote his own words, "I did not fancy them, I would
gladly have avoided them. I was no archæologist, ethnologist,
or antiquary, and I had no desire to become
such. My tastes in the matter, however, did not dispose
of the subject. The savages were there, and there was
no help for me; I must write them up to get rid of them."
To compile information concerning the manners and customs,
the mythology, the language, and the antiquities
of these aborigines, Mr. Bancroft estimated that two
volumes would be required: (Lit. Ind., 301). The Native
Races as completed is a work of five volumes. So much
of an expansion in all of the early historical plan was
necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. Bancroft, wrote but two hundred and seventy out
of the four thousand pages of the Native Races, devoting
his time while that series was in preparation largely to a
rewriting of the first volume of Central America, to a
continuation of a summary of early voyages for other
volumes, and to a perfection of the plan and a collecting
of material for the histories. His relation to this work
may be likened to that of a managing editor. He decided
upon the division of labor as suggested by Oak or
others, and required changes in the manuscript as completed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
if he considered them necessary, either for the
sake of treatment or style, but the extent of his writing
as printed in this work certainly falls far short of that
necessary to substantiate the claim which he has made
to its authorship. The chapter which he wrote was that
on the Hyperboreans. As to this work, he tells us in the
Literary Industries that during the first half of the year
1873 he "was writing on northern Indian matter, giving
out the notes on the southern division to go over the
field again and take out additional notes": (Lit. Ind. 571).
As to his further connection with the work, he says
that in December of the same year he became convinced
that the plan of treating Indian languages adopted
by Goldschmidt was not the proper one, and that the
latter was "obliged to go over the entire field again
and re-arrange and add to the subject matter before I
would attempt the writing of it." (Lit. Ind., 573.) This
passage ascribes the actual preparation of the volume to
Goldschmidt, and the writing referred to here must have
been largely in the nature of editorial work. It is hardly
to be presumed that a man of Mr. Bancroft's education
and slight literary experience would have attempted at
this time anything so ambitious as the complete preparation
of a treatise on Indian languages.</p>

<p>We see, then, that although the influence of Mr. Bancroft
was felt in arrangement and even in style, the Native
Races was written almost entirely by other persons.
But one would hardly suppose that such was the case
from reading the words: "During the progress of this
work I succeeded in utilizing the labors of my assistants
to the full extent of my anticipations": (Lit. Ind., 304).</p>

<p>When speaking in the Literary Industries of work done
for him by others, Mr. Bancroft shows a habit which is
derived from his long experience as manager of a business
concern. His constant tendency is to speak of work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
done by those in his employ as his work, neglecting a
distinction between a publisher and an author, which is
a vital one. The reputation of a publishing house depends
upon the workmanship of its employés, but that
of an author depends solely upon his own talents and the
work of his own hands. While a publisher may with all
propriety speak of work done by agents as his printing,
for him to say that writing done for him by others is his
writing is a positive misstatement. When Mr. Bancroft
paid his writers for their manuscript, he became its owner
with full rights of publication, but no one will say for a
moment that he thereby became the author. In speaking
of the Native Races, as well as the History of the
Pacific States, Mr. Bancroft often does so in such terms
as to indicate that writing was done by him when it was
his only by purchase. (Compare statements in Literary
Industries, 303, 568, 571, and in Native Races I, preface
xiii, with the facts as shown by the statements of different
members of Bancroft's literary corps as to the work
actually done by each writer and as given later in this
article.)</p>

<p>The division of responsibility for collating and arranging
facts for the various divisions of the Native Races
was made apparently toward the latter part of the year
1872. We are told that routine work was laid aside for
three or four weeks in the middle of the summer, and
this time devoted to placing the library in order and
cataloguing the new books which had been added. This
was obviously done preparatory to entering upon the
new work. To a young Englishman who called himself
T. Arundel-Harcourt, and who entered the library in
November, was assigned the preparation of that portion
of the work devoted to the manners and customs of the
civilized nations. (This man's true name he did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
reveal. His collaborator Nemos says that he attended a
boarding school, and then continued his studies in Germany,
at Heidelberg, according to his own account. He
claimed to have come to America with $5,000 in pocket
money, and found his way first to Montana. On his arrival
at San Francisco he entered the library. Leaving
in 1874 to assume editorship of the <i>Overland Monthly</i> with
Fisher, he was soon back in Bancroft's employ. Naturally
he was the most able of the library corps. But while
he was brilliant, handsome, and witty, he was at the
same time erratic and unreliable. He died in 1884.)</p>

<p>Mr. Fisher's part was mythology, while the division
of the work relating to language was given to Albert
Goldschmidt, a German, who had been employed in the
library since the end of 1871. (According to Nemos,
Goldschmidt was said to have been the son of a Jewish
clothing dealer at Hamburg. In early life he ran off to
sea, and claimed to have become master of a vessel. He
had acquired much general knowledge, and was musically
inclined, often singing in church choirs. Before
coming to the library Nemos says that he led a "vagarious
life" in Nevada. As a linguist he had great ability,
and was able to translate almost any language which he
encountered, but was inclined to fritter away his time.
Nemos declared him "the most systematic idler in the
library." This failing brought about his discharge.
Later he became a mining superintendent in Chihuahua.)
Mr. Oak took the subject of Antiquities and Aboriginal
History (preface to Native Races I, p. 13).</p>

<p>The undertaking was an enormous one, because of the
vast quantities of material to be handled, as well as the
inexperience of the workers, which made it necessary for
them to devise their own system as they proceeded. It
is said that by an actual calculation the sum total of all
the labor expended upon each of the five volumes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
series represents an equivalent to the work of one man
for ten years. (Literary Industries, 305). Indeed, Mr.
Bancroft's own reason for entrusting this work to others
is that it would have taken him a half century, leaving
his main work untouched. Mr. Oak's indexing system
proved a great labor saver, as by it the indexers went
through all the material, classifying and making references.
They were followed immediately by note-takers,
who copied the facts indicated in these references. The
writers then had the data placed before them for arrangement.
When Mr. Bancroft's chapter on the Hyperboreans
was completed he went over it with them, all making
criticisms and suggestions to be adopted in the arrangement
of the other divisions as well as that one. By this
means was the library system perfected, a common
method developed, and a corps of library workers trained:
(Lit. Ind., 304).</p>

<p>The Native Races was very much in the nature of a
compilation, and our knowledge concerning the authorship
of its various parts is necessarily less exact than is
true of any of the other Bancroft works. Such facts as
are at hand come from two schedules&mdash;one of his own
works, the other of that of the corps generally&mdash;prepared
by William Nemos, a gifted Swedish writer who entered
the library in 1873, subsequently becoming Oak's chief
assistant, and ultimately his successor in the librarian's
office; from separate information gained by Frances
Fuller Victor as to the part of the work done by Oak.
(This consists of three different statements, one in a letter
to a friend, another in an autobiographical sketch,
and a third in a statement copied by Mrs. Victor. Mr.
Oak himself refuses to give testimony, doubtless on account
of his former intimate personal connection with
Mr. Bancroft and his acquiescence in the plan followed,
as well as his poor health, which renders him unwilling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
to enter into a discussion of the question, and from statements
in an autobiography of Thomas Savage, chief
Spanish interpreter in the library after August, 1873.)</p>

<p>The facts as deduced from these sources show that Oak
wrote more of the Native Races than any one else, two
fifths of the entire work, or to be exact, fifteen hundred
and ninety-seven pages out of four thousand. While
engaged in this writing, it must be remembered that he
also acted as "chief assistant to Mr. Bancroft, manager
of all details of this work, as well as that on the History,
overseer of the corps of workers, and chief proof reader,"
duties which so engrossed his time that he wrote principally
between eight o'clock in the evening and midnight.
The fourth volume on Antiquities is his work
entire, as is also the fifth on Primitive History, except
the introductory chapter on the Origin of the Americans,
in the preparation of which it would appear that Bancroft
had a hand (Lit. Ind., 570), and the last three chapters
dealing with the tribes of Central America, the authorship
of which the writer has no means of determining.
Nemos says, however, that he prepared "a good deal of
clean manuscript" for this volume as well as for some
others.</p>

<p>To Harcourt the division of the field as already given
points as the author of the second volume. Oak wrote
the introductory chapter entitled General View of the
Civilized Nations, and also the chapter on the Aztec Picture
Writing and Maya Arts Calendar and Hieroglyphics.
Bancroft is the author of the chapter on Savagism and
Civilization, and Nemos is to be credited with the writing
of some parts. As Harcourt wrote six hundred and thirty-six
pages of the Native Races, and there appears but one
reference to his writing in connection with another volume,
and that a chapter of a hundred and fifty pages, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
may conclude that the remainder of Volume II is from
his pen.</p>

<p>With Fisher rests the credit for the authorship in the
main of the Mythology portion of the third volume.
Nemos relates that Fisher sought his aid for this work
soon after he came to the library, believing that his previous
training in philosophy fitted him for mythology,
and that Fisher obtained for him the continuation of the
volume, when in October, 1874, he left it "half finished"
to accept the editorship of the <i>Overland Monthly</i>. Nemos
then being new to the work, Harcourt revised his manuscript.</p>

<p>To Goldschmidt had been assigned the task of writing
the treatise on Indian languages for the third volume.
The evidence of Nemos shows that Goldschmidt prepared
this part of the work, although the quotation from the
Literary Industries already given seems to show that it
was revised throughout once, and afterward rewritten,
in part, at least, by Bancroft. Goldschmidt also prepared
the ethnographical map of the coast.</p>

<p>Of the first volume, Oak wrote about half of the preface,
and the chapter on the Columbians, Harcourt the
chapter on the Californians, and Nemos and Savage the
remainder, with the exception of a few slight parts prepared
by others.</p>

<p>In a compilation like the Native Races, there was of
necessity much matter printed in such a form that those
who prepared it could not claim the authorship. Of this
character were the contributions of Mr. Savage, the Spanish
expert. Nemos also claimed to be the author of parts
of every volume except the fourth, but from his own statements
we learn that much of his work, like Savage's,
consisted in making translations.</p>

<p>The public acknowledgment made in the introduction
of this work concerning the part done by the several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
writers would be fair, if we overlook the fact that its
wording tends to give an exaggerated idea of Mr. Bancroft's
part in it&mdash;were the name of the latter but printed
on the title page as editor or compiler. But by omitting
either word he has announced himself to the world as
author. His own explanation for this seems to be that
he considers himself responsible for the work in treatment
and style (Native Races I, Preface XIII), but the
real reason is no doubt to be found in a desire to give the
work standing in the literary world by ascribing it to one
name already quite widely known among book dealers
and publishers.</p>

<p>As regards scientific merit these volumes can not make
great claims. No serious attempt was made to collect
facts concerning the American Indians of the West at
first hand. Mr. Bancroft made no pretensions as an
antiquarian or ethnologist, content with compiling what
others had written and thus discharging his duty toward
the introductory part of his work that he might the
sooner take up the more serious task of writing the histories.
Different parts of the Native Races differ greatly
in value. Oak was habitually scholarly and always made
an effort at honest research. Nemos was likewise thoroughly
reliable. Goldschmidt was noted for his shiftlessness,
and Fisher and Harcourt are charged with such
uncritical methods as the incorporation in their writings
of statements found in magazine articles which were
nowhere verified. (Mrs. Victor had learned of this.) The
last three must, therefore, be considered clever and brilliant
writers rather than critical historians.</p>

<p>The chief value of the Native Races consisted in the
fact that it presented in accessible form a classified collection
of all the facts known concerning the Indians of
the Pacific slope. Philosophers who made use of these
facts in their generalizations, while prizing the work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
highly, were not, however, especially concerned as to
how it was written. In the East and in Europe the discovery
was not made that it is merely a compilation.
The Native Races was regarded as a work of great learning
(see Literary Industries, 335, 356) and its authorship
ascribed to Hubert Howe Bancroft in accordance with a
literal reading of its title page. The five volumes were
published at three-month intervals between October 1,
1874, and Christmas, 1875. Just before the first volume
appeared, Mr. Bancroft made what he called a literary
pilgrimage to the Eastern States to bring himself and the
work to the notice of the great literary men there. He
also made arrangements for publication in France and
Germany simultaneously with the issuing of the volumes
in New York. This was the result as told in his own
words: "Never probably was a book so generally and so
favorably reviewed by the best journals in Europe and
America. Never was an author more suddenly or more
thoroughly brought to the attention of literary men
everywhere": (Lit. Ind., 361.)</p>

<p>As director and manager of the Native Races, Mr.
Bancroft performed a literary service of great importance
and in such a capacity richly deserved the unsparing
praise which was showered upon him. But the commendation
and honor bestowed upon him as author of
the work we must in all fairness regard as quite a different
matter. According to his own statement (Lit. Ind.,
361), this must be considered as the status generally assigned
him and the basis upon which he was presented
with a number of complimentary certificates and honorary
diplomas, among them being honorary membership
in the Massachusetts Historical Society, the American
Antiquarian Society, and the Buffalo Historical Society,
and the honorary degree of Master of Arts at Yale.</p>

<p>So far as the question of authorship was concerned, all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
reviews and general press mention of subsequent Bancroft
publications followed along the same line as the reviews
of the Native Races, recognizing Mr. Bancroft alone
as the author. We may, therefore, conclude as does he
himself (Lit. Ind., 361, 661) that it was his being accredited
with the authorship of the Native Races which made
for him his literary reputation. It has been shown that
this credit depended in turn upon the fact that his own
name was on the title page as author instead of managing
editor. The facts show, therefore, that Mr. Bancroft
was assisted largely by his corps of writers even in the
revision of manuscripts, that due credit has never been
given Oak, Fisher, Harcourt, Goldschmidt, and Nemos,
who, aided by a number of compilers and writers of fragmentary
bits, are the true authors of the work, and that
the rise of the fame of Hubert Howe Bancroft as an historical
writer was founded upon a popular misconception,
both as to the nature of his first work and his connection
with that work.</p>

<p>Just as fast as the members of the library force ended
their respective labors on the Native Races, they were set
to work taking notes for the history, Mr. Oak continuing
to act as manager of detail as heretofore. The system of
note-taking was perfected by Mr. Nemos and now included
a boiling down process by which new members
could so prepare rough material as to permit writers to
turn out manuscript more quickly.</p>

<p>Laying aside for the time being the work on Central
America and Mexico, Bancroft and Oak decided to direct
the activities of a library force now thoroughly trained to
the material on California, since California history is the
starting point for that of a number of other states, including
Northern Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah,
and more especially because the mass of original material
collected for this state was greater than for any other, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
fact necessitating the reduction to a minimum of the possibility
of its accidental destruction while yet unused:
(Lit. Ind., 583.) The actual organization of the material
on the Southwest, including the writing of the history of
the Northern Mexican states and Texas down to 1800, together
with the Spanish and Mexican annals of Arizona,
New Mexico, California, and the Northwest Coast, was
entrusted to Oak as his special field.</p>

<p>The story of the collection of this California material
as told by Mr. Bancroft (Lit. Ind., 365 and sq.) is one of
the most interesting connected with the history enterprise.
In October, 1873, there had entered his service one
Enrique Cerruti, an erratic individual, born in Italy, but
intimately acquainted with the ways of Spanish-Americans
through a long residence in Bolivia, under the government
of which state he had served in a diplomatic
capacity. Cerruti's diplomacy was turned toward the
securing of historical facts in the possession of the old
Spanish residents of California, and the first task set for
his craft was to gain the coöperation of General Vallejo,
a native Californian, early alcalde at San Francisco, and
colonizer of Sonoma. After several months' negotiations,
his efforts were rewarded by a personal narrative from
Vallejo, by the gift of his papers, and by his enthusiastic
support in gaining the aid of other Californians of his
own race. Among those who furnished dictations at his
instance were two of his brothers, and his nephew Alvarado,
Governor of California under Mexican rule. For
two years Cerruti and Vallejo worked together collecting,
their time being divided between Sonoma, San Francisco,
and Monterey, from which centers they made divers excursions.
It seems that the wily Italian, together with
other representatives of Mr. Bancroft, sometimes gained
possession of valuable manuscripts by such indirection as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
to cause much dissatisfaction on the part of the original
owners.</p>

<p>The official Spanish records of the country which had
been turned over to the United States Surveyor General at
San Francisco consisted of four or five hundred volumes.
To copy these, twelve Spaniards worked for a year under
the direction of Mr. Savage,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> "the greatest single effort"
ever made in connection with the Bancroft enterprise.
The mission records in possession of the archbishop of
San Francisco were copied by Mr. Savage and three assistants
in a month. In quest of data on Southern California,
Bancroft and Oak took a trip to San Diego early
in 1874, returning overland and visiting depositories of
records. On this tour, Judge Benjamin Hays of San
Diego turned over to Mr. Bancroft his historical collections,
and subsequently directed the collecting in the
south. The most efficient of the assistants employed by
him was Edward F. Murray who, among other services,
copied the records of the Santa Barbara missions. In
March, 1877, Mr. Savage began work on the civil and
ecclesiastical archives at Salinas, continuing the work at
San José, Santa Cruz, and Sacramento. With others,
he obtained dictations of the highest importance from
native Californians and others, and in 1877 and 1878
spent eight months in that work, visiting all the missions
from San Diego to San Juan Bautista with the exception
of San Fernando and Purisima.</p>

<p>While his aids were thus gathering the material upon
which the History of California is founded, Mr. Bancroft,
as he tells us (Lit. Ind., 657-663), was devoting his attention
more especially to the gaining of information concerning
the proceedings of the two vigilance committees
that held sway in San Francisco in the "fifties," by no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
means an easy task, since the acts of both of these organizations
were illegal and their surviving members could
not be expected to talk very freely, even after a lapse of
twenty years. After considerable urging, however, those
who had custody of the records were induced in the interest
of history to turn them over for Mr. Bancroft's inspection.
This material was made use of in the supplemental
volumes on Popular Tribunals; in the first writing of
which Mr. Bancroft was himself engaged from 1875 to
1877. Like his manuscript for Central America, however,
this work had to be revised before its publication
ten years later.</p>

<p>At an early date, Mr. Bancroft tells us (Lit. Ind., 623-628),
he had corresponded with the heads of governments
lying within his territory. The presidents of the Mexican
and Central American republics and the governors of all
the states had accorded him every facility. In 1874, especially
favorable letters were received from the presidents
of Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, the latter
appointing a special commissioner to secure and ship
documents.</p>

<p>The great mass of California matter, at first so voluminous
as to be appalling, was now in hand, and in 1878
Mr. Bancroft turned his attention to the Northwest. Upon
a visit to British Columbia in that year, he obtained access
to the official records of the province, took the reminiscences
of many old fur traders, secured the papers of
others, and had help from several who had undertaken
to write a history of the country: (Lit. Ind., 534; Hist.
N. W. Coast, preface, viii). It was from this data that
Mr. Bancroft in the years immediately following wrote,
with the aid of some other writers, the History of the
Northwest Coast, and the History of British Columbia,
volumes constituting the great part of the work of which
he can claim the actual authorship: (See Lit. Ind., 549.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span></p>

<p>The history seeker had already secured the writings of
Gov. Elwood Evans of Washington Territory. Crossing
the straits from Victoria, he made some collections about
Puget Sound, and then went to Portland and Salem,
accompanied by Amos Bowman, a stenographer who
subsequently became one of the writers in the library and
prepared some manuscript for the History of British Columbia.
(Bowman was a Canadian with some experience
in government surveys and mining explorations. Before
joining Mr. Bancroft on this expedition, he was located
at Anacortes, Washington.) The Oregon Pioneer Association
was then in session at Salem, and a number of its
members furnished dictations. The secretary, J. Henry
Brown, was engaged to copy documents in the state
archives (Lit. Ind., 540-546). He subsequently made
this matter the basis of a book which he himself published
on Oregon history.</p>

<p>After dictations had been secured in passing through
Southern Oregon, the Oregon material at Mr. Bancroft's
disposal was further increased on his return to San Francisco
by the employment of Frances Fuller Victor, a
writer of experience and author of several books on Oregon,
who, during a residence of more than ten years in
the state, had collected data with the intention of herself
writing and publishing its history. As by her researches
she had become familiar with the history of the entire
northwestern part of the United States, the working up
of this field was assigned her just as the southwest had
been assigned to Oak.</p>

<p>(Frances Fuller was born in the township of Rome,
New York, May 23, 1826. She was a near relation of
Judge Reuben H. Walworth, Chancellor of the State of
New York, and through her ancestor, Lucy Walworth,
wife of Veach Williams, who lived at Lebanon, Connecticut,
in the early part of the eighteenth century, claimed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
descent from Egbert, the first king of England. Veach
Williams himself was descended from Robert Williams,
who came over from England in 1637, and settled at
Roxbury, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Victor was thirteen years of age, her parents
moved to Wooster, Ohio, and her education was
received at a young ladies' seminary at that place. From
an early age she took an interest in literature, and when
but fourteen years old, wrote both prose and verse for
the county papers. A little later the <i>Cleveland Herald</i>
paid for her poems, some of which were copied in English
journals.</p>

<p>Mrs. Victor's younger sister, Metta, who subsequently
married a Victor, a brother of Frances' husband, was
also a writer of marked ability. Between the two a devoted
attachment existed, and in those days they were
ranked with Alice and Ph&oelig;be Carey, the four being referred
to as Ohio's boasted quartet of sister poets. The
Fuller sisters contributed verse to the <i>Home Journal</i> of
New York City, of which N. P. Willis and George P.
Morris were then the editors. Metta was known as the
"Singing Sybil." Both sisters were highly eulogized by
Willis, who regarded them as destined for a great future
as writers.</p>

<p>In her young womanhood Frances spent a year in New
York City, amid helpful literary associations. Being
urged by their friends, the two sisters published together
a volume of their girlhood poems in 1851. In the more
rigorous self-criticism of later years, Mrs. Victor often
called it a mistaken kindness which induced her friends
to advise the publication of these youthful productions.
But in these verses is to be seen the true poetic principle,
and their earnestness is especially conspicuous.</p>

<p>Metta Fuller Victor, after her marriage, took up her
residence in New York City, and continued her literary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
work both in prose and in verse. Frances' husband,
Henry C. Victor, a naval engineer, was ordered to California
in 1863. She accompanied him, and for nearly
two years wrote for the San Francisco papers, her principal
contributions consisting of city editorials to the
<i>Bulletin</i>, and a series of society articles under the <i>nom de
plume</i> of Florence Fane, which, we are told, by their
humorous hits, elicited much favorable comment.</p>

<p>About the close of the war, Mr. Victor resigned his
position and came to Oregon, where his wife followed
him in 1865. She has often told how, upon her first arrival
in this state, she recognized in the type both of the
sturdy pioneers and of their institutions something entirely
new to her experience, and at once determined to
make a close study of Oregon. As she became acquainted
with many of the leading men of the state, and learned
more and more about it, she determined to write its history,
and began to collect material for that purpose.</p>

<p>Her first book on the history of Oregon was The River
of the West, a biography of Joseph L. Meek, which was
published in 1870. Many middle-aged Oregonians tell
what a delight came to them when in boyhood and girlhood
days they read the stories of Rocky Mountain adventures
of the old trapper Meek as recited by this woman
of culture and literary training, who herself had taken so
great an interest in them. The book was thumbed and
passed from hand to hand as long as it would hold together,
and today scarcely a copy is to be obtained in the
Northwest. Intensely interesting as The River of the
West is, the chief value of the work does not lie in this
fact, but rather in its value to the historian. Meek belonged
to the age before the pioneers. It was the trapper
and trader who explored the wilds of the West and
opened up the way for the immigrant. Later writers
freely confess their indebtedness to Mrs. Victor's River
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
of the West for much of their material. The stories of
the Rocky Mountain bear killer, Meek, romantic though
many of them are, check with the stories given by other
trappers and traders, and furnish data for an important
period in the history of the Northwest.</p>

<p>In 1872 was published Mrs. Victor's second book
touching the Northwest, All Over Oregon and Washington.
This work, she tells us in the preface, was written
to supply a need existing because of the dearth of printed
information concerning these countries. It contained
observations on the scenery, soil, climate and resources
of the Northwestern part of the Union, together with an
outline of its early history, remarks on its geology, botany,
and mineralogy, and hints to immigrants and travelers.
Her interest in the subject led her at a later date
to revise this book and to publish it again, this time
under the title Atlantis Arisen.</p>

<p>In 1874 was published Woman's War With Whiskey,
a pamphlet which she wrote in aid of the temperance
movement in Portland. Her husband was lost at sea in
November, 1875, and from this time, she devoted herself
exclusively to literary pursuits. During her residence
in Oregon she had frequently written letters for the San
Francisco <i>Bulletin</i> and sketches for the <i>Overland Monthly</i>.
These stories, together with some poems, were published
in 1877 in a volume entitled The New Penelope.</p>

<p>This last volume was printed by the Bancroft publishing
establishment in San Francisco. The Bancrofts were
an Ohio family of Mrs. Victor's early acquaintance.
Hubert Howe Bancroft now laid before her his plan for
writing the history of the Pacific slope, and asked her to
work on the part concerning Oregon. In 1878 she entered
the Bancroft library. Leaving the library at the
completion of the work, in 1890 she returned to Oregon
and was employed by the state in 1893 to compile her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
History of the Early Indian Wars of Oregon, a volume
which was published by the State Printer the following
year. She continued to write for the Oregon Historical
Quarterly up to the time of her death. Her last published
work was a small volume of poems printed in 1900,
and selected from the many metrical compositions which
she had written for newspapers and magazines through
a period of sixty years. She was an able writer of essay,
and possessed an insight into the evolution of civilization
and government rare, not only for an author of her
sex, but for any author. Combining the qualities of
poet, essayist and historian, she occupied a position without
a peer in the annals of Western literature. She died
at Portland, Oregon, November 14, 1902).</p>

<p>Data on Alaska and the Russian Colony at Fort Ross,
California, were being collected and translated during
these years by Ivan Petroff, a highly educated Russian
some time resident at Cook's Inlet. Material from Russia
was furnished by the savant M. Pinart who had made
a special study of Alaska, and Petroff prepared translations.
In 1878 he visited Alaska in search of more material,
and spent the year 1879 and part of 1880 in
Washington extracting matter from papers, the existence
of which he had discovered on the northern trip; (Lit.
Ind., 551-561.) Petroff had begun the writing of this
material and had done part of the Alaska volume when
he left the library to become supervisor of the census of
1880 in the Northern Territory, leaving Mr. Bancroft and
others to bring this part of the work to completion.</p>

<p>(The main facts of Petroff's life which had been a very
eventful one are here taken from Bancroft's Literary Industries,
270-272. He was born at St. Petersburg in
1842, his father being a soldier. His mother died in his
infancy, and at the age of five, he was placed in the
military academy of the first corps of cadets at St. Petersburg.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
Left an orphan when but a boy by the death of
his father at the battle of Inkerman, a remarkable talent
for languages secured his transfer to the imperial academy
of sciences for training as military interpreter.
A serious illness caused an impediment in his speech
which ended such prospects, but he was nevertheless
permitted to continue his studies and became amanuensis
for Professor Bohttink while engaged in the preparation
of a Sanscrit dictionary. Attached subsequently to M.
Brosset, who was making a study of Armenian antiquities
and literature, he became so proficient in the language
that he was chosen to accompany his superior on a two-year
scientific expedition through Georgia and Armenia.
He was then sent to Paris to St. Hilaire with part of the
material obtained, thence sailing for New York in 1861.
After working a short time on the <i>Courier des Etats Unis</i>,
he enlisted in the seventh New Hampshire regiment.
By hard study he mastered the language, after writing
letters for the soldiers as a means of practice, and acquired
a proficiency in the use of English such as one
seldom meets with in a foreigner. From private he became
corporal, then sergeant and color bearer, a rank
which he held in 1864, when his company was sent to
Florida. He took part in all the battles fought by Butler's
army and was twice wounded. After the battle of
Fort Fisher, he was promoted to a lieutenancy. Mustered
out in July, 1865, he returned to New York, and accepted
a position for five years with the Russian American
Company at Sitka, believing that this region was sooner
or later to pass to the United States. On the way to Alaska
he was delayed and improved the time by making a horseback
tour of Northern California, Idaho, Washington,
and Oregon. Finding his position filled when he arrived
at Sitka, he was given charge of a trading post on Cook's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
Inlet until the transfer of the territory to the United
States in 1867. Subsequently Petroff was appointed acting
custom officer on Kodiak Island and was put in charge
of the seized barkentine Constitution, with which he arrived
in San Francisco in October, 1870. Mr. Bancroft at
once sought his services as Russian interpreter for the
library. After his return to the government service in the
north, he distinguished himself both in 1880 and 1890 by
his zeal in securing information concerning Alaska desired
by the census bureau, and several times risked his
life in this service. Returning to Washington he was
subsequently employed both by the census bureau and
the state department. With one exception, the Utah volume,
this was the last of the series of history proper to
the actual authorship of any considerable part of which
Mr. Bancroft can lay claim.)</p>

<p>So great was the opposition created among Gentiles in
Utah by a turn in the Bancroft history more favorable to
the Mormons than they considered fair, and so many and
so fierce the charges against Mr. Bancroft in consequence,
that he has apparently been very careful to give, in the
Literary Industries (pp. 631-640), an extended account
of the manner of collecting the material for the History
of Utah. Here he tells us that, at an early date in the
development of the history project, he realized the difficulty
of gaining data on Mormon history, an obstacle
apparently so great as to be insuperable. For though
the Mormon church have a regular historian, whose duty
it is to preserve their archives, the director of the Bancroft
project at once perceived the objections which would
be made to the turning of this material over to be written
up by one not in sympathy with their faith. But he
must have seen very clearly that a Gentile history of Utah
not unfavorable to the Mormons was the one thing they
desired above all else. Accordingly, in 1880, he tells us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
that he succeeded in showing to their satisfaction that he
was not prejudiced against them, and asked Orson B.
Pratt, official historian of the Mormon church, for the
desired information. John Taylor, president of the
church, called a council of its twelve apostles, with the
result that it was agreed to comply with the request, and
Franklin D. Richards was sent to San Francisco as Professor
Pratt's representative, to furnish the Bancroft
library with such material as was desired from the official
church records.</p>

<p>The year 1880 is an important one for the history project
in another and more important respect also. The
end of that year found definite plans made for the publication
of the History of the Pacific States. Mr. Bancroft
had long since decided that, unlike the Native Races,
this work should be handled exclusively by his own house,
and Mr. Nathan J. Stone was placed in charge of the
publication department of the firm, now A. L. Bancroft
and Company, to attend especially to this matter. The
date of commencement of work by the printers Oak sought
to have deferred that there might be no haste in searching
out and digesting facts, but against his advice Bancroft
determined to begin the publication of the series in
1882, impatient doubtless at the prospect of a deferred
return from his large financial investment in the work,
and somewhat fearful, as he tells us, lest through some
calamity it might never come to publication.</p>

<p>This decision for an early beginning of publication
with the general change in plan which it brought, rendered
Mr. Oak's complicated tasks too severe, as he was
now in failing health. The work of taking notes on the
vast amount of material on California and the Spanish
Southwest generally had been finished some time before,
and, as Oak had now completed his preliminary researches,
he determined to give up part of his duties that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
he might have time to write the volume covering his field.
To Mr. Nemos, who up to this time had been employed
chiefly on the Mexican volumes, was accordingly turned
over the general direction of the half-dozen younger
writers, together with the plans of writing, and the management
of the note-takers, a change which gave him all
interior supervision except over special departments attended
to by Mr. Bancroft&mdash;such as the work of Oak and
Mrs. Victor. Nemos had wonderful ability for drilling
men into a common method and served as director of library
detail "with remarkable ability and success."</p>

<p>(This was Oak's expression. All who speak of Nemos
have much commendation for his ability. He was born
in Finland, February 23, 1848, the son of a nobleman.
German and piano lessons were first given him by his
mother, who belonged to a wealthy family of good stock.
After a year's study in a private school at St. Petersburg,
he returned home to attend school, and later took a course
at the gymnasium, or classic high school, at Stockholm
preparatory to entering Upsala university, where a
brother was at the time in attendance.</p>

<p>This ambition was not to be attained, however, for in
his seventeenth year, family matters compelled him to
give up his studies, and a place for him was found in a
London commission and ship-broker's office by a family
friend who believed that the acquisition of English and a
business experience would be of the greatest advantage
to the young man. Rather than drag the family title
into the by-ways of trade, he laid it aside and assumed
the name of Nemos.</p>

<p>Evening and leisure hours were now devoted to the
study of philosophy and kindred higher branches under
an Upsala graduate. After a business training of eighteen
months, he was transferred to a responsible position in a
house trading with India. When five years had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
spent in this capacity, the fear of consumption induced
him to take a long sea voyage, and in the spring of 1870
he left Liverpool by sailing vessel for Australia, arriving
at Melbourne in the third month out. A venture at mining
resulted disastrously through the dishonesty of his
partners, and after a stop at Sydney, he came to San
Francisco, where he landed in the summer of 1871. He
had completed an engagement as assistant civil engineer
on a proposed railroad in Oregon when he returned to
California and accepted a position in the library. Nemos
is described as retiring in all his tastes and enthusiastic
as a student. He was especially fond of philosophy and
languages, and had a knowledge of all the principal
tongues of Europe.)</p>

<p>Oak, although he now considered himself chief only in
name, still acted as librarian, business agent for most of
the intercourse with the printing house, and reviser of the
final proofs of all the volumes.</p>

<p>For protection against fire, the library was in October,
1881, moved to a building constructed for its reception
on Valencia Street. At the same time, the printers began
work on the first volume to be published, Central America
I, which was immediately followed by Mexico I. After
that time Mr. Bancroft (Lit. Ind., 585,) gave out for the
press whatever was most convenient, so that frequently
parts of several volumes were in type at one time. When
the printing began, material aggregating fifteen volumes
was ready. These included manuscript for Mexico and
Central America, the field assigned Savage and Nemos,
matter prepared by Oak for California, by Mrs. Victor
for Oregon, by Bancroft for Popular Tribunals, Literary
Industries, and The Northwest Coast, and by Petroff for
Alaska. Bancroft estimated at this time that the notes
were also taken for three fourths of the works which
were yet to be written.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span></p>

<p>Material upon which to base the remaining fourth was
collected in the same way as previously, Mr. Bancroft
visiting the country to be written up, ascertaining the
nature and location of the materials, collecting what could
be had conveniently, and then leaving the further ingathering
in the hands of agents. A visit to Mexico in
1883 furnished him with some material on social conditions
in that country which he tells us was utilized in
the last volume of the Mexican history: (Lit. Ind., 701).
More extensive collections remained to be made in the
regions farther north.</p>

<p>After the completion of the two volumes on Oregon,
Mrs. Victor's attention was next directed to the volume
on Nevada, Colorado, and Wyoming. In the carrying on
of this work, a greater number of suggestions as to manner
of treatment were made by Mr. Bancroft, we may
believe, than was usual in the preparation of a volume,
for the reasons that it was hurried more for publication
than earlier works, that it was written under his immediate
direction, and that he himself collected and forwarded
material from the field as required. The record
of the progress of the work, as it occurs in Mr. Bancroft's
letters to the writer of the volume, is of unusual interest
in that the methods followed, though in some ways exceptional,
may perhaps be taken as fairly typical of those
employed by Mr. Bancroft in the preparation of the later
volumes of the series which he immediately supervised.</p>

<p>In August, 1884, shortly before the completion of the
second volume of the History of Oregon, Mr. Bancroft
went to Salt Lake City, where he left with Franklin D.
Richards a memorandum to guide him in extracting material
on the Mormons in Nevada which, he said, would
be about the first material needed. Pending the arrival
of this, on September 11th, he advised Mrs. Victor to
familiarize herself with the history of Wyoming and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
Colorado, he himself having done the same for Nevada.</p>

<p>A letter written a few days later presents the idea of
making a plan of the volume "as the men do on Mexico,
etc.," and says, "By so doing you can give each section
its due proportion and by working to the plan save unnecessary
labor." As to the method of treating early
expeditions to Colorado and Wyoming, he says to consult
the History of Utah, and the two opening chapters
which he himself had already written on Nevada. When
these chapters were prepared, it was the intention to devote
an entire volume to this state. In planning the
work as recommended in this letter, Mrs. Victor ascertained
that these chapters were out of proportion for the
volume as now planned, and wrote to Mr. Bancroft to
this effect. On September 21st, however, he advised her
that he recognized the fact, but that they would "have
to do." On the same date he forwarded the dictations
of three of the first Mormons in Nevada, requesting that
when the material had been used for this volume, they be
turned over to Mr. Bates, then at work on the History of
Utah. He also suggested a perusal of Benton's City
Saints and other Utah books for light on Nevada, and
directed that Mr. Newkirk search the library thoroughly
for Nevada material.</p>

<p>From Colorado Springs on October 7th he wrote announcing
that a package of material on Colorado had been
sent, though evidently with more thought of pleasing those
who furnished the dictations than of affording material
for the history of their state. Said he, "Some of the
dictations don't amount to much, but I would like them
used for all they are worth, and more too, putting them in
list of authorities, quoting them freely, and giving biographical
notice, etc." On October 11th, he wrote that
he would go to Denver in a few days to finish gathering
what material for Colorado he could procure. With
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
reference to this he says, "I am told that there is no file
of the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i>, or any other early paper I
can get. Possibly I may obtain access to one. Still I
think we will have stuff enough, all there will be room
for. I will then go to Cheyenne to get what I can on
Wyoming, and that will finish up the business of gathering
for that volume, or any other volume except what
the canvassers bring in."</p>

<p>He calls attention to the fact that in the Colorado dictations
there is frequently material on Montana, and in the
Utah dictations, material on Idaho and Nevada. The
reason for this he gives in the typical Bancroft sentence:</p>

<p>"If I strike a man here, as I frequently do, who has
been to these other places in early times I follow him up
there for all it is worth of course, the same as here."</p>

<p>At Colorado Springs Mrs. Helen Hunt Jackson, author
of a Century of Dishonor, asked Mr. Bancroft to adopt
her views on the Colorado Indian wars. With reference
to this matter, he wrote on October 13th, the day of his
departure for Denver, as follows:</p>

<p>"She wishing a thing done would be the very reason
I would not do it if I could help it. I speak of it that
you may get the work and use the information. I do not
care about mentioning her name one way or another in
the whole work. She has been polite enough here,
although she has a broken leg, but I don't care for her
politeness. I should have had fair recognition for the
service I did her in the matter of her California articles
in the <i>Century</i> which I never got."</p>

<p>Writing subsequently from Denver on November 2d, he
says: "Everybody in Colorado, nearly, is against Mrs.
Jackson on what some call the Chevington massacre.
That side don't call it a massacre, but a fight. I should
give their side in full, then say some few took exception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
to this action, and there let it stand on its merits&mdash;that
is, I think so now."</p>

<p>In the same letter Mr. Bancroft announced that he was
going over the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i> with Mr. Byers, the
founder and former editor, "a man of remarkable ability
and memory," whose dictation to a shorthand reporter
was given, he said, in such a way that it was almost
pure history and could be taken from his manuscript as
fast as one could write. This he advised Mrs. Victor to
take as a basis for Colorado history, building upon it and
giving it the preference in regard to discrepancy of statement.
He also called attention to the fact that "a lot of
people" had in one way and another wandered over the
region before white men settled there, and said he supposed
that what Coronado did should first be considered.
As to the wanderings of Spaniards in Colorado, a schedule
sent about this time refers Mrs. Victor to all Oak had
written on the subject, to the first few pages of the History
of Utah, and to the original authorities upon which
the latter was based. After calling attention to some
works of travel, such as Fremont's writings and Renton's
Adventures in Mexico and the Rocky Mountains, he asked
Mr. Nemos to see that the material for Mrs. Victor's use
in preparing the volume be taken out more thoroughly
than had heretofore been the case, and upon this point
directed him to consult the early volumes of the series
and make this correspond. Mrs. Victor subsequently
asked that she be permitted to take out her own notes,
and the request was granted as Mr. Bancroft had now
decided to reduce the number of his force as fast as possible
and bring the work to a conclusion. Already on
October 25th, he had given as his opinion that Colorado
should make about half of the volume, at the same time
inquiring what laws of Colorado and Wyoming were desired,
and recommending a study of "Hepworth Dixon's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
work on the Great West, Bonneville's Adventures, and
Bayard Taylor's Travels."</p>

<p>Writing from Cheyenne on November 8th, Mr. Bancroft
announced the shipment of a small package of Wyoming
stuff, all that he had been able to secure, and also his intention
to have some one take matter from the office files
of the newspapers of that place, the <i>Sun</i> and <i>Leader</i>, the
latter of which was very complete. Though returning
himself to Denver, that day, he promised to have more
Wyoming dictations taken.</p>

<p>In a letter dated the next day, he expressed the opinion
that a proper division of the work would be made by devoting
three hundred and fifty pages to Colorado, two
hundred and twenty-five to Nevada, and one hundred
and seventy-five to Wyoming, and requested that the
writing be done on that basis until some change should
be found necessary. In closing, he suggests another line
of research to be carried through the volume in the words:
"And all the way from the Gulf of Mexico to British
Columbia, I want to pay special attention to the cattle
interest and cattle men, the origin and development of
the industry, one of the most marvelous and important
of modern times."</p>

<p>The last letter dealing with the manner of treatment
of material dated October 9, 1885, asks Mrs. Victor to do
the best she can with Mackey and the silver question in
order to satisfy Mr. Stone, the publishing agent, whose
work, Mr. Bancroft said, was hard enough at best.</p>

<p>It thus appears that three leading objects were kept
constantly in mind at this time: one, the handling of
the various subjects in such a way as not to displease the
people in the district written up, that the work might be
popular and the work of the canvassers easy as they went
about soliciting subscriptions for it; another, the writing
of the various chapters in such a way that the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
draft would constitute finished history and take up no
more space than that assigned in the volume; and finally,
and really at the bottom of the preceding, a desire to have
the history written as soon as possible. Evidence that
Mr. Bancroft wished to have the work done in the least
possible time and with the least possible cost is abundant
in these letters.</p>

<p>In October Nemos had been set to counting the pages
which Mrs. Victor had written since entering the library,
a proceeding which she resented, believing that it afforded
no just basis for judging her historical work. The next
letter from Mr. Bancroft, on October 20th, brought the
request that she bring the work "at first writing within
the requisite compass so as not to make it so terribly
costly." An intimation that greater haste would be pleasing
was again conveyed on November 1st, when Mr. Bancroft
expressed the confidence that if Mrs. Victor were to
write three volumes more, they would be done in three
years instead of six, a view of the case most contrary to
hers, since before entering the library she had already
worked out many of the problems in Oregon history, and
now that she was entering upon another field, found more
time necessary. That Mr. Bancroft did not make allowance
for this, however, is shown by a letter written on
November 17th. Here he begins the subject by stating
that it would be a great mistake to suppose that he was
dissatisfied with Mrs. Victor's work, or that any one had
in the faintest degree criticised it, and says that all he
wants is to practice such economy of time and money as
will enable him to complete the work before he is dead
or has failed in business. Then he proceeds to reckon up
results thus:</p>

<p>"I do not know when the present volume will be finished
ready for the printer. But six years have already
passed, and, calling this volume done, it would be two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
years to a volume. About fifteen hundred of your pages
make a volume, I believe, and counting three hundred
days to the year, would be two and a half pages a day.
When you first came, you started off with ten pages,
which we all thought rapid, but the outcome makes it
exceedingly small. This, with what other work has been
done on your volumes, would make every page of your
manuscript ready for the printer cost me considerably
over two dollars a page."</p>

<p>After a denial that this is intended as a complaint about
the past, he says:</p>

<p>"Go on and do the best you can. I have written equivalent
to six volumes during the last six years besides
devoting my time to revising and outside matters. But I
don't expect any one to work as I do. I am not satisfied
with old hands now, however, who do not give me say,
four or five pages a day all ready for the printer."</p>

<p>According to the printed rules of the library, the hours
were from 7.15 sharp to 6 o'clock in the evening, with
half an hour for lunch. When we recall the complexity
and minuteness of research and thought necessary in historical
writing, we must consider three hundred such
days a year heavy work. The requirement of an average
of a certain number of pages a day was therefore one
which would naturally tend to increase the worry of the
writer. This requirement was also exacted of Mr. Oak,
and we may well conclude that if such pressure were
brought to bear on the two most experienced writers in
the library, upon the junior writers it must have been
intense indeed.</p>

<p>The writing of the volume on Colorado, Nevada, and
Wyoming, so far as the material at hand permitted, was
completed at the end of the year 1885. With all of the
precautions taken, however, the pages on Colorado had
to be condensed nearly a third to bring them within the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
space allowed. This was done, as was frequently the
case, by throwing matter into fine type and printing as
footnotes, instead of making many changes in the manuscript.</p>

<p>The system of biographical footnotes as it appears in
the history, Mrs. Victor claimed as her contribution to
the general plan of the work. The idea was followed
with excellent results in her own volumes as well as those
written by others, the object being to make biographical
mention for the benefit of posterity of every man who
took a prominent part in the building of a Pacific state
or territory. For carrying out such a purpose, the time
of writing during the lives of at least part of the same
generation that founded these commonwealths, offered
unusually good advantages.</p>

<p>The original intention, Mrs. Victor has told us, was for
her to prepare the volume on Utah, since before coming
to the coast, she had had occasion to make a study of
early Mormon history through coming in contact with
some refugees from Nauvoo. But so much work had
already been assigned her that when the time came to do
the writing, this was impossible. Mr. Bancroft had already
made a study of the early Spanish history of the
territory, and had written this part when he assigned the
work on the bulk of the remainder to Mr. Alfred Bates,
a writer of polished English and a man of scholarly attainments
who had previously assisted Mr. John S. Hittell
in his work on The Commerce and Industries of the
Pacific Coast. (From Literary Industries, 267-68, we
learn that Bates was a native of Leeds, England, born
May 4, 1840. His father was a wool stapler who lost his
fortune in the panic of 1847. Compelled at an early age
to earn his own livelihood, he began teaching at the age
of fifteen, and later taught at Marlborough College of
which the dean of Westminster was then head. To him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
young Bates became private secretary in 1862. While
preparing for Cambridge the following year, he accepted
a lucrative position in New South Wales, where he suffered
much from ill health, at one time being given up
by three doctors. An offer of a position as teacher in
California took him thither and he continued at this work
for a year. During the two years spent with Mr. Hittell,
he was the most valued of his assistants.) Those acquainted
with the circumstances and the men have
accordingly held that certain incidents in Utah history
unfavorable to the Mormons could not have been toned
down by Bates as they are in the printed volume, and
that the Mormon turn to the work was therefore given by
Bancroft in the pages which he wrote and in his revision
of Bates' work. (See article by Frances Fuller Victor in
<i>Salt Lake Tribune</i> of April 14, 1893.) This seems probable
from what Mr. Bancroft tells us of his efforts to secure
material for the volume from the Mormon church,
as well as his natural desire to please subscribers to the
work.</p>

<p>Mr. Nemos, who was a foreigner, had no preference as
to the field in which his writing was done, and it was
consequently scattered through different volumes. Besides
collaborating with Mr. Savage and others on the
Mexican and Central American volumes, he wrote part
of the material on British Columbia and Alaska. By the
time Mrs. Victor's third volume was completed at the
end of the year 1885, Oak had completed his work on the
North Mexican States and the five volumes on California
under Spanish and Mexican rule. The writing of the
two volumes containing the American portion of California
history was thereupon assigned to Mrs. Victor and
Nemos, the former assuming responsibility for the preparation
of the political chapters, a field in which her work
had been pronounced especially good, and the latter taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
up the institutional chapters, a part which he had
largely fulfilled toward all the Spanish volumes of the
history.</p>

<p>The introduction of the institutional feature is to be accredited
to Nemos. The writing done by Oak was in the
form of annals, a form in general suited admirably to the
provincial records which he worked up; but against such
a style throughout the series, Nemos tells us that he presented
suggestions and arguments to Mr. Bancroft for introducing
material which should tell the history of the
people, and that in this he prevailed.</p>

<p>In April, 1886, the burning of the Bancroft business
house threatened temporarily to bring the history project
to an abrupt termination at a time when only the first
volumes had been published, but the enterprise soon recovered
from the blow. Under the leadership of Mr. Bancroft,
both business and history writing went on as before,
the firm of Bancroft and Company being organized for the
conduct of the former, while the publication of the history
previously carried on as a department of the general book
concern was now turned over to The History Company,
a corporation organized by Mr. Bancroft for the purpose
of handling the work.</p>

<p>At the completion by Oak of his volume on New Mexico
and Arizona in May, 1887, he retired from the library
with health very much shattered, leaving Mr. Nemos at
the head of affairs. After spending some time on a new
work now undertaken by Mr. Bancroft, the latter also
severed his connection with library matters in August,
1888.</p>

<p>At the time of Oak's departure, Bancroft was planning
a biographical work to be issued at the conclusion of the
task which was then engaging the attention of the library
force. This work, at first called Chronicles of the Kings,
but published under the title Chronicles of the Builders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
of the Commonwealths, was to present in detail the lives
of wealthy and influential men who had borne a prominent
part in the affairs of the various Pacific Coast states.
For such notice they were charged from a thousand to ten
thousand dollars according to the length of the published
sketch. (This is according to the printed schedule, the
minimum price being paid for three pages print, the
maximum for thirty. This included also the printing of
a portrait engraved on steel.) The attempt to burden
the prestige gained by the histories and their projector
with such a load could result only in crippling both.
The volumes printed subsequent to the inauguration of
this scheme could not be received with the same open-mindedness
as former works. The information subsequently
made public that money was accepted for notice
in the Chronicles lost for Mr. Bancroft the regard of the
press of the coast, caused grave doubts to be expressed
concerning his disinterestedness as an historian, called
out an expression of many bitter&mdash;in some cases utterly
false&mdash;statements concerning his work, and sadly damaged
the literary reputation he had been for nearly twenty
years building on the work done under his direction.</p>

<p>While it was inevitable that the publication of the
Chronicles as a parasite upon the history should result
thus disastrously and deplorably for the fame of the latter
work, we must not fail to recognize the fact that the
labors of the writers upon both works were not a whit
less conscientious and painstaking than they had always
been. After the sixth and seventh volumes of the California
history were completed in 1888, the volume on
Washington, Idaho, and Montana was written. In 1890,
the final volume on California was published, followed
in the next year by the supplementary volumes, Essays
and Literary Industries, which ended twenty years of library
work for Hubert Howe Bancroft and his assistants.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span></p>

<p>The History of the Pacific States, we have seen, was
an evolution, passing through the stages of handbook and
encyclopædia before it became a history. But when the
last idea had been reached, the development of the project
was by no means complete, but rather just begun.
The necessity of the Native Races was demonstrated before
work had proceeded for a twelve-month. As late as
1878, Mr. Bancroft estimated that the history proper
would comprise but fourteen volumes at the outside.</p>

<p>In his letter to Mrs. Victor, dated August 1st of that
year, we get an interesting glimpse of the plan in an earlier
stage. The work is to be divided, he says, somewhat
in the following manner: Conquest of Darien, one volume;
Conquest of Mexico, one volume; Mexico under
the Viceroys, two volumes; Mexican Revolution and Modern
History, one or two; Explorations Northward and
the History of California, three or four; the Northwest
Coast, Oregon and British Columbia together, two or
three; Alaska, one. Under the head of California history
was to be included somewhere the histories of Arizona,
New Mexico, Utah, and Nevada, and the history of
Oregon was likewise to include Washington, Idaho, and
Montana. Oregon and British Columbia he thought
could be written in a year. Not until six more years had
passed was it finally recognized that natural expansion
as the work proceeded would necessitate devoting to the
series of history proper a number of volumes exactly
double that which was then contemplated. To this series
were added as a supplement an even half dozen volumes.</p>

<p>If we find that the outline grew from that of a few volumes
in 1872 to one of almost forty in 1884, and that the
work expanded fourteen volumes after it had been definitely
laid out, we are not at all surprised that the part
of the whole which Mr. Bancroft intended to write grew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
relatively less as time went on, and the part assigned to
others became correspondingly greater. There is some
evidence to show that when writing began on the first
volume of the Central American History in 1873, the director
of the project actually had in mind the plan which
he gives in the Literary Industries, that of writing with
the aid of assistants who were to be responsible for "the
study and reduction of certain minor sections" which he
was to "employ" in his own writing. Thus we find, according
to the information left by Nemos, that Bancroft
actually wrote half of the volume, that Oak at first took
out notes, and that Nemos prepared his work in the rough,
leaving a considerable part of it to be rewritten. For
the next volume undertaken, the first of the six on Mexico,
we see that the chief was unable to prepare so much material
in its final form, and rested with but two chapters
completely to his credit, together with the rewriting of
part of Nemos' work on the remainder. In four or five
years, he expresses the determination of writing what he
can himself and leaving the rest to his aids. This as we
shall see amounted in the end to his doing about one
seventh of the history, slightly revising the work of the
other authors, often by the aid of critics in his employ,
and preparing most of the material for the supplementary
volumes.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that the original plan, the plan as
published, was exactly reversed, and instead of Mr. Bancroft's
doing all the work in final form, except some minor
sections assigned to those whom he called his assistants,
it was the so-called assistants who really wrote the History
of the Pacific States, and Mr. Bancroft who did a
few minor, or at any rate less difficult parts. Nor is it at
all true, as one authority has said (Appleton's Encyclopædia
of American Biography, I, 156), that Mr. Bancroft
wrote the most important chapters. Of course, the surprising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
thing about this is that Mr. Bancroft should have
stated in the Literary Industries that he had followed a
plan for the division of labor originally intended, but not
followed at all. Especially unfortunate is this, in view
of repeated charges of absorbing the literary reputation
of his collaborators and aids, and appropriating the credit
for their work.</p>

<p>It has long since been recognized that the name of
Hubert Howe Bancroft can not be placed in the ranks of
great American historical writers. In the first place, he
wrote only parts of volumes. It will be observed, too,
that as a rule he wrote simpler parts, consisting of synopses
of early voyages, or annals easy to handle, such as
the rovings of Spaniards in Utah, or the rise of a provincial
government among the fur-traders of British Columbia.
But Mr. Bancroft, as founder of the library and
organizer of the history, has rendered a real and lasting
service to historical literature.</p>

<p>The first great end subserved by his undertaking was
the preservation of a great mass of invaluable historical
material, which would otherwise have been lost. In 1880,
he wrote:</p>

<p>"There are men yet living who helped to make our history,
and who can tell us what it is better than their sons,
or than any who shall come after them. A score of years
hence few of them will remain. Twenty years ago, many
parts of our territory were not old enough to have a history;
twenty years hence, much will be lost that may
now be secured": (Lit. Ind., 635).</p>

<p>It is thus for the timeliness of his labors in collecting
his library that the Pacific Coast, and the whole world as
well, is indebted to Mr. Bancroft. For this work his
qualifications as a successful business man experienced
in handling books were exactly those required.</p>

<p>A second great end which Mr. Bancroft attained was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
the founding of a history of Western North America on
the original sources which he had collected in order that
it might constitute a foundation upon which future histories
would be built.</p>

<p>"He who shall come after me," says he in the letter
quoted above, "will scarcely be able to undermine my
work by laying another and deeper foundation. He must
build upon mine or not at all, for he can not go beyond
my authorities for facts. He may add to or alter my
work, for I shall not know or be able to tell everything,
but he can never make a complete structure of his own."</p>

<p>That the volumes supervised by Mr. Bancroft should
contain imperfections is in the nature of the case inevitable.
Perfect historical estimates of contemporaries can
not as a rule be made, and history based largely on personal
reminiscence must contain errors of refraction
which can be corrected only in the clearer light of later
years. The handling of material by a writer who did not
collect it, and who is likely to find the places and conditions
dealt with strange to his experience, inevitable
though it be in so large an undertaking, results in the
writing of faulty history. The hastening of the work
and the editorial revision of manuscripts by a manager
desirous of pleasing subscribers, and impelled by various
other motives of his own, are not circumstances likely to
increase the accuracy of the work. But after allowance
has been made for all inaccuracies which have crept in
through these various avenues, we still have the fact that
the histories are based upon sources which may be supplemented
but can never be displaced. No greater mistake
could be made, therefore, than to say that because
they contain errors they are worthless. All must agree
with the practical argument made by a thoughtful old
pioneer of the writer's acquaintance that, in spite of all
criticisms which may be passed upon the Bancroft histories,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
they contain a great fund of information which is
nowhere else to be found in print.</p>

<p>A third result of the history plan, and one which is of
importance to historical writers everywhere who have
large fields to cover, was the devising of a coöperative
method for organizing the vast collections in the library.
Mr. Bancroft makes the claim of having been the first to
resort to such a division of labor; and points out (Literary
Industries, 767) that his method avoids the repetition of
details and insures a more thorough working up of the
field than does the coöperative method as the term is
usually understood, under which the writers work independently
of each other after the field is divided. Such
a claim might indeed be granted had Mr. Bancroft announced
himself as editor and reviser instead of author,
and had he designated the part of the work written by
each of his collaborators in accordance with the usual
custom in coöperative works. The printing of his name
as author on the title page, and his general recognition
as such in accordance with press notices following those
of the Native Races, have, of course, largely lost for him
the credit of originating a coöperative method for the
organizing of large quantities of material.</p>

<p>Concerning the understanding Mr. Bancroft had with
his corps of writers generally as to the public acknowledgment
of their work which he would make, information
is not at hand. Only one had ever before written
and published a book, and perhaps the majority gave no
thought to the rights which would be theirs as authors.
Certain it is that when the greater number of the more
prominent writers entered the library, the work was
planned on a much smaller scale than that upon which
it was carried out, and, as they did not know that they
were to become the authors of entire or consecutive volumes,
the question was not then of the importance which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
it assumed with the later growth of the series. What
the understanding was with those who first entered the
library we can not say definitely, but his ideas on that
subject seems to have been a survival of the encyclopædia
project. To Mrs. Victor, just prior to her entering his
service, he wrote on August 1, 1878:</p>

<p>"The work is wholly mine. I do what I can myself,
and pay for what I have done over that; but I father the
whole of it and it goes out only under my name. All
who work in the library do so simply as my assistants.
Their work is mine to print, scratch, or throw in the fire.
I have no secrets; yet I do not tell everybody just what
each does. I do not pretend to do all the work myself,
that is, to prepare for the printer all that goes out under
my name. I have three or four now who can write for
the printer after a fashion; none of them can suit me as
well as I can suit myself. One or two only will write
with very little change from me. All the rest require
sometimes almost rewriting."</p>

<p>He further adds that it gives him pleasure to acknowledge
his obligations to his assistants, but that this acknowledgment
is always voluntary on his part and not
claimed as a right by them, and says that while he is not
sure of mentioning certain persons in connection with
certain parts as he had done in the introduction to the
Native Races, he will certainly not do more than that.
The only mention which he promises definitely to his
writers is a biographical notice in the Literary Industries.</p>

<p>"The work in the library," says he, "good or bad, is
mine; were it not so, I would simply do what I could
with my own fingers, or do nothing."</p>

<p>It is easy enough to see why Mr. Bancroft should wish
to have absolute control of manuscripts to insure good
work, and a complete covering of the field, but it is difficult
to see how he could justly make the claim before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
the world that manuscripts turned out by other persons
were his writing.</p>

<p>Not only was the myth of Mr. Bancroft's authorship
repeated on the title page of each volume of the history,
and in the reviews which built upon the prestige gained
by him as supposed author of the Native Races, but not
a word was printed to show that any one else wrote the
least part of the work. When asked to indicate in the
preface the part done by each person, according to the
evidence of a number of his writers, he always declared
that this was just the one thing he wished to avoid. The
only approach to an acknowledgment is the statement
in the preface in words which apparently refer only to
indexers and note-takers, that he has been "able to utilize
the labors of others," among whom as the most faithful
and efficient he mentions Oak, Nemos, Savage, Petroff,
and Mrs. Victor. (History of Central America, I, preface
viii). The promise is made that he will speak of these
and others at length elsewhere, and this promise is redeemed
by the printing of their biographies in the Literary
Industries without indicating who was engaged in
writing and who in purely routine work connected with
the library, much less designating what parts of the work
each had done. From a popular edition of this volume
subsequently issued for wider circulation, even these
were stricken out.</p>

<p>While the real authors of the history never agreed to
keep silence concerning their right to recognition, it was
very well understood that they would remain in Mr.
Bancroft's employ only so long as they acquiesced in his
claiming the work as solely his own and made no individual
claims for themselves. This bread and butter
argument for silence proved effective in all cases. An
example of the method in meeting claims made for any
of the library writers occurs in connection with the publication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
of the History of Oregon. A notice of the work
just before it was issued was sent to the Oregon press
and the statement made that Mrs. Victor was the author.
(Emma H. Adams in Portland <i>Oregonian</i>, October 5,
1886, under the title, "Mrs. Victor and Her Latest Literary
Work.") This was met by Mr. Bancroft with a
letter for publication in the paper printing the notice, in
which he asserted that no entire volume of the series had
been written by Mrs. Victor. Of course the significance
of this statement is in the word "entire," which simply
meant that he had interpolated a line here and there
as he went over the manuscript. A note to Mrs. Victor
under date of October 16th explains this apparent denial
of her authorship thus:</p>

<p>"I do not want for myself the credit due to my assistants.
At the same time, I do not deem it necessary to
explain to the public just what part of the work was done
by each. Everybody knows that you have been at work
on Oregon, and that is all right, although I have done
considerable work on your manuscript for better or worse,
or at all events to make it conform to the general plan."</p>

<p>In view of Mr. Bancroft's persistent refusal to give
"assistants" anything like credit for their work in accord
with general custom and literary ethics as well, and in
view of the fact that this refusal meant that the public
would credit him solely as the author, it must have been
a difficult matter for him to convince his corps of writers
that he did not want the credit due them.</p>

<p>The process of making Mrs. Victor's manuscripts conform
to the general plan, which is here regarded as the
principal source of alteration, according to Oak, meant
nothing except the condensation of her work, mainly by
the omission of considerable portions, in order to bring
it within the space assigned. That such revision did not
affect her claims to authorship, is of course apparent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span></p>

<p>It is sufficiently clear, from what appears above, that
Mr. Bancroft's public justification of himself for publishing
under his own name all the work done in the
library is the fact that he reserved the right to alter all
manuscripts and make what changes he saw fit. This
made him managing editor, however, not author. The
comparatively few additions he made to the manuscripts
can not justify such a claim. That the revision of Mrs.
Victor's work consisted in the main of nothing more
than leaving out parts appears from two cases already
cited, one in connection with the History of Colorado,
Nevada, and Wyoming, the other with the History of
Oregon, as well as from the direct statements of those
who supervised library work. As we have seen he demanded
that his writers turn out a certain number of
pages a day "all ready for the printer," so he could have
had little occasion to revise their work. The writers
who Mr. Bancroft said in 1878 wrote with very little
change from him were of course Oak and Nemos. Now
Oak wrote seven and a half volumes of the history, and
Nemos and Mrs. Victor five each, while Bancroft wrote
four&mdash;a total of at least twenty-two volumes out of the
twenty-eight to the authorship of which no serious claim
could be made on the ground of altered manuscripts.
Moreover, Savage says in his autobiography that, while
Bancroft made additions and amendments to the three
volumes which he wrote, in some of his pages only a
word or two was changed and that others remained intact.
What rewriting was occasionally done on the
remaining volumes, was apparently done as often by
other persons as by Mr. Bancroft. His relation toward
the work was therefore exactly the same as that of a
managing editor toward the matter printed in a newspaper.
The latter could never claim the authorship of the articles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
written by his staff, although altered to a considerable
extent by him or by his direction.</p>

<p>It should be stated here that Mr. Bancroft justified
his course to those in the library by insisting that they furnished
him merely with rough notes, and that it would be
necessary for him to rewrite the work, or at any rate,
considerable portions of it. This, had it been done,
would have been strictly in accord with the account of
his connection with the work as printed in the Literary
Industries. But it was not done, and the account as
printed is incorrect.</p>

<p>Since the completion of the history, but one of the
writers has publicly claimed the authorship of the volumes
written in the library. Ill health, only too common
with those who labored through the work, has in most
cases been a sufficient barrier to such action. Savage
and Bates remained in Mr. Bancroft's employ for a
number of years engaged in other work, and of course
under such circumstances could not make any claims.
Nemos as a foreigner could not be expected to take much
interest in such matters, and his early return to Europe
and subsequent residence there have rendered it difficult
for him to make such a statement did he so desire. Mrs.
Victor alone has printed a general statement of the portions
of the history written by her, a course in which she
was influenced by years of absolute independence in directing
her literary energies before entering Mr. Bancroft's
employ, and a consequent appreciation of the
rights and honors of authorship. Four volumes of the
Bancroft histories were exhibited as her work at the Mechanics
Pavilion in San Francisco during the fair in
January, 1893, and also among a collection of the works
of New York women authors made the same year (<i>Utica
Morning Herald</i>, May 4, 1893). A special preface over
her name inserted in the first volume of the Oregon history
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
in the exhibit claimed the authorship of the volumes.</p>

<p>(These are the words of the preface: "It seems not
only just, but necessary to affix my name to at least four
volumes of the History of the Pacific States, although
that does not cover all the work done on the history by
myself. The four volumes referred to comprise the states
of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Colorado, Wyoming,
and Nevada. My name is therefore placed on the
backs of these volumes without displacing that of Mr.
Bancroft.")</p>

<p>As to the shares of the various writers in the history
proper, we have the sources of information which have
already been mentioned in speaking of the Native Races,
supplemented by very full data left by Mrs. Victor concerning
her part in the work. It is thus possible to give
in a general way the authorship of each volume, barring
fragmentary writing.</p>

<p>From these sources it is found that during the progress
of the work on the Native Races, Mr. Bancroft had after
hard labor and much revision completed his introduction
to the History of Central America, and had written a half
of the first volume. Oak wrote half of the preface and
the fine print summary of explorations, and Nemos was
responsible for a third of the volume from page 460 on,
although he prepared material in the rough, leaving it to
be rewritten by a German aid whose name is not given,
but who may have been a man by the name of Kuhn
mentioned as having done work on the second volume.</p>

<p>Of this latter volume, Mr. Bancroft wrote one chapter,
apparently the first, which deals with Pizarro and Peru.
Nemos and a writer named Peatfield (J. J. Peatfield, described
by Bancroft [Lit. Ind., 265-267,] as a "strong
man and one of talent," was born in Nottinghamshire,
England, August 26, 1833. His father, a clergyman, educated
him for the church and he took his degree at Cambridge

in 1857, being graduated in the classical tripos.
The church, however, was distasteful to him, and he obtained
a tutorship, subsequently in 1862 going to Nicaragua
to engage in cacao cultivating. This enterprise
proved a failure. After attempting cotton, cacao again,
and finally coffee all in vain, in 1865 he became a bookkeeper
at San José, the capital of Costa Rica. In January,
1868, he was made a clerk and translator to the legation
at Guatemala, and two years later, British Consul General
for Central America. While holding the consulship of
Guatemala a third time, he resigned on account of ill
health and went to San Francisco, where he arrived in
November, 1871. Becoming bookkeeper and cashier for a
Nevada mine at White Pine, and battling much with ill
health, he returned to San Francisco, where he acted as
teacher and bookkeeper until February, 1881, when he
entered the library), labored together on the volume and
prepared half of it, and Bates a fourth. Kuhn wrote a
fifth which was partly rewritten by Nemos. The latter
claimed about a fourth of a volume as the actual material
written by him for the first and second volumes together.</p>

<p>The third volume, including the history of Central
America in the nineteenth century, was written by Savage,
who, nearly all his life had been engaged in the
consular service of the United States in Cuba and Central
America.</p>

<p>(Thomas Savage, according to a biography written by
himself, was born at Havana, Cuba, August 27, 1823, a
short time after his parents had removed thither from
Philadelphia. His father, a descendant of the earliest
settlers of Massachusetts and a brother of Savage, the
famous genealogist of New England, was from Boston,
and his mother, a native of Charleston, South Carolina,
was the daughter of a French planter who had escaped the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
great massacre in San Domingo and a Maryland woman
of Jewish extraction).</p>

<p>In childhood, Savage was several times taken to the
United States and back as the necessities of his father's
business demanded. At the age of fifteen, he had studied
the Latin classics, advanced mathematics and languages,
nearly breaking forever his health, which had always
been feeble. Abandoning his studies and taking a long
rest in the country, he regained sufficient strength to
enable him to support himself, for his parents had now
lost their fortune. He entered a commercial house at
Havana, and after working a few years as bookkeeper,
in the summer of 1846 joined the United States consulate
as clerk and translator. From that time until the end of
the year 1867, he was attached to the consulate, rising
successively to the positions of secretary to the consul
general, deputy consul general, and vice consul general.
From 1854 on, there was not a single year during which
the consulate general was not in his charge for several
months. During the War of the Rebellion he was several
times in charge, once for twenty months, and during this
trying period won the confidence of his government by
laboring hard to do his whole duty.</p>

<p>He spent the greater part of the year 1868 in the United
States, and then went to Panama, where he was engaged
as assistant editor of the <i>Star and Herald</i>, having charge
of the Spanish portion of the paper. Savage had lost a
wife in Cuba, and in January, 1870, married a second time.
Shortly afterward, he embarked for Salvador, where he
taught English in the University, became consul-general,
and finally started a newspaper. Just as this last enterprise
was beginning to pay, his wife's precarious health
necessitated his removal to a better climate, and he settled
in Guatemala. Here he established a fine printing
office, and began the publication of a newspaper. Though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
aided by the government, the business nevertheless proved
unprofitable, and after selling out at a heavy loss, he
came to San Francisco in 1873. Throughout life, Savage
was a constant reader, with a special fondness for history.
He once said that he believed he had read the histories
of all the world.</p>

<p>From a perusal of what Nemos says concerning the
History of Mexico, we are led to infer that Bancroft again
wrote the introduction, as the former librarian credits his
chief with two chapters of the first volume. Nemos wrote
the remainder, but Bancroft rewrote some of his work,
he said only a fifth, much of the revision consisting in a
mere change of words. Oak differed with him on this
point, holding that Bancroft did more rewriting, but
Nemos persists that this is an exaggeration.</p>

<p>The second volume was done by Nemos, Savage, and
Peatfield, Nemos writing the first half and some later
chapters, two thirds of the volume in all, Savage one
fourth, and Peatfield a little.</p>

<p>Of the third volume, Nemos wrote between a third and
a half, including, as he tells us, the leading institutional
and political parts, Savage a third, a writer named Griffin
(George Butler Griffin was a native of New York
state, and a graduate of Yale. He was a linguist, and
had been an engineer in South America. Apparently
early in the eighties, his connection with the library had
ceased. He died by his own hand.) two or three chapters,
and Peatfield a part.</p>

<p>Of volume four, Bancroft did one chapter, Peatfield a
fourth of the whole, and Savage a third. Nemos "assisted
on parts," his work aggregating a fourth of the
volume.</p>

<p>The fifth volume of the Mexican History, embracing
the period from 1804 to 1861, was known as Savage's
volume. Of the manuscript, he actually wrote about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
two thirds. Nemos did about a fourth, including the fall
of Mexico and the leading war episodes. Some of the
writing was done by Peatfield. (In conversation he
claimed to have written a large part of the Mexican War
chapters.)</p>

<p>The last volume of the Mexican History was prepared
chiefly by Nemos and Savage, the latter writing the first
and last chapters, the former about two thirds of the volume,
including the history of Maximilian and the institutional
chapters. Peatfield did a little work on this
volume. Oak's contribution to the History of Mexico,
according to his own statement, consisted of a "few slight
parts."</p>

<p>The history of the northern part of Mexico, and the
Southwest of the United States was Oak's special field,
designated by him as The Spanish Northwest. The entire
first volume of the History of the North Mexican
States is his work. The history of Lower California in
this volume, as well as that in the next, was based on a
manuscript on Lower California written several years
before by Harcourt. But this work was so altered by
both Oak and Nemos in their respective volumes through
condensation, the changing of conclusions, and the adding
of new material, as to amount to a rewriting.</p>

<p>The History of Texas in North Mexican States, second
volume, is the work of Peatfield; the remainder of the
volume, between a third and a half, that of Nemos. (The
Texas part was subsequently extended by Peatfield for
the edition now in circulation, that it might find a better
sale in that state.)</p>

<p>The volume on Arizona and New Mexico is the work
of Oak alone.</p>

<p>Spanish and Mexican California likewise belonged to
Oak's field and the first five volumes of the History of
California are from his pen. (Nemos adds, "though he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
neglected to put in institutions, leaving them for W. N.
[himself] and Savage." In view of Oak's oft-repeated
assertion that he was sole author of these five volumes,
this must mean that they were supplied in other volumes.
Moreover, there are no institutional parts properly speaking
in these five volumes, and if such parts as "Mission
Progress," "Commercial Affairs," and the like are to
be regarded, they make up half the work.)</p>

<p>The early American history of California was a topic
in which Mr. Bancroft was naturally interested because
of his own mining experience during the early gold days.
Nemos' schedule shows that he wrote sixty pages for the
sixth volume of California, a circumstance which taken
with our knowledge of fields of research into which he
entered in the preparation of California Pastoral and
Popular Tribunals makes us reasonably sure that he
wrote the first, second, and twenty-fifth chapters. Mrs.
Victor, who in her work on Oregon had been found especially
strong as a writer on political subjects, was assigned
the task of working up the political history of
California, and, according to her own statement, wrote
two hundred and thirty-four pages for this volume. We
can positively identify chapters twelve, thirteen, twenty-three,
and twenty-four as her work. From the similarity
of their subject-matter to some already treated by her in
the Oregon history, and from the fact that their addition
to the work just indicated brings the total almost exactly
to the figures given, we may conclude that she also wrote
the third, fourth, and fifth chapters. The chapter entitled
Mexican Land Titles is Oak's work, and the remainder
of the volume, almost two thirds, is that of
Nemos.</p>

<p>Information given by Mrs. Victor shows that she wrote
for the final volume of the History of California four
hundred and eighty-nine pages on politics and railroads.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
We are thus enabled to designate as her work chapters
nine to twenty-one inclusive, and chapter twenty-five.
This still leaves to her credit eighteen pages to be located
in some other chapter. The rest of the volume, embracing
the portions dealing with commerce, manufactures,
agriculture, and mining, was written, Nemos says, by
himself. Before publication, the sheets on California
judiciary were submitted to Justice Stephen J. Field
for his approval. The estimate of certain pioneer characters
in the California history, together with the adopting
of the Mexican view of the conquest of that state by
Americans, brought down upon Mr. Bancroft the condemnation
of the California Society of Pioneers, who, in
1894, expelled him from honorary membership in their
body. (See pamphlet proceedings of the Society of California
Pioneers in reference to the History of Hubert
Howe Bancroft.) It is a curious fact, however, that the
passages which were made the basis of the society's indictment
are almost entirely in the first five volumes of
the California history, which were written by Oak. He
has declared that even the revisions were his own and not
Bancroft's.</p>

<p>The History of Utah, another storm-center among the
histories, was written by Bates and Bancroft, the former,
according to Nemos, preparing twice as much manuscript
as the latter. The earlier chapters are by Bancroft, but
no more certain assignment of their respective shares in
the work can be made from the information at hand.</p>

<p>The History of Nevada, Colorado, and Wyoming, as
already noticed, was written by Mrs. Victor, with the exception
of the first two chapters on Nevada, which were
by Bancroft. Mrs. Victor's statement of her work includes
these also, perhaps by inadvertence. It is possible
that she rewrote them, however, as Mr. Bancroft had
admitted that they were out of proportion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span></p>

<p>In the work on the Northwest Coast, we again see
Bancroft's predilection for early voyages. The first half
of Volume I, including the Spanish explorations of the
coast, belonged to Oak's field, and was written by him.
Bancroft wrote most of the remainder of the two volumes,
which included the maritime fur trade, the Lewis and
Clark expedition, the Astor enterprise, the Northwest
and Hudson Bay companies, and the later American fur
trade.</p>

<p>A hundred pages on the "Oregon Question" written by
Mrs. Victor for Oregon were incorporated in the second
volume of the History of the Northwest Coast. She had
taken the American side of the case, a view with which
Mr. Bancroft was not in sympathy. By his order, Mr.
Oak rewrote the subject from an English standpoint.
He added chapter fifteen, but to some extent made use
of her work in preparing chapter sixteen. Mrs. Victor
always claimed that he merely altered it, Oak himself
that he rewrote it. The remainder of her manuscript
was retained and printed as chapter eighteen.</p>

<p>The volume on Washington, Idaho, and Montana, was
written wholly by Mrs. Victor, a task for which she was
fitted by her work on early Oregon history.</p>

<p>The History of Oregon was also her work, a fact which
has been known and fully recognized by prominent Oregonians
since the day of its publication. She had contemplated
writing such a work even before the beginning
of Mr. Bancroft's project, and it was only a realization
of her inability to compete single handed with the capital
and other resources at his disposal which caused her
to enter his employ. In collecting material within the
state, she had the assistance of such pioneer families as
her friends the Applegates and McBrides, and among
others, of Judge Deady and Elwood Evans. Valuable
data concerning Hudson Bay rule in Oregon were furnished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
her in a correspondence with Mr. A. B. Roberts
and Mr. Allen, formerly of the Hudson Bay Company.
(This correspondence is now in the possession of Mr.
E. H. Kilham, of Portland, Or.) The work as written
made more than two volumes, and condensation was necessary.
A chapter on geology and mining was omitted
by Mr. Bancroft; the disposal of the manuscript on the
"Oregon Question" has already been noticed, and matter
on the San Juan boundary dispute and the Modoc war
was also incorporated in other volumes. Mrs. Victor
considered the first volume of the History of Oregon as
perfect as it could be made at the time. With certain
features of the second she was not so well satisfied, the
most prominent being the omission of the history of the
Oregon Steam Navigation Company, necessitated by Mr.
Bancroft's failure to secure material, and certain changes
made by him in her manuscript on Indian Wars in Southern
Oregon in such a way as to throw blame upon the settlers
(Mrs. Victor in [Salem] <i>Oregon Statesman</i> February
24, 1895). It is worthy of note that her history is the
first to pass over the political results attributed to Whitman's
ride by previous writers. The sheets of the Oregon
history before they were issued were submitted to
Judge Deady for his approval.</p>

<p>In the half of the History of British Columbia which
he wrote, Mr. Bancroft utilized some of the material that
he had collected in person. Bates prepared a fourth of
the manuscript, and Nemos and Bowman together the remainder,
Nemos writing some of the chapters and revising
others.</p>

<p>The History of Alaska afforded Mr. Bancroft an opportunity
for further research in the field of early voyages.
He is credited with half of the volume, Bates with a third,
Nemos a little, and Petroff about a fourth. Nemos places
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
all of his own writing on this work and British Columbia
together at a third of a volume.</p>

<p>A review of the facts shows that if we exclude the comparatively
few interpolations and changes made by Mr.
Bancroft, we can with assurance declare the authorship
of all portions of the third volume of Central America, of
the volumes on California, and of those on the North
Mexican States, Arizona and New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado,
and Wyoming, the Northwest Coast, Oregon and
Washington, Idaho and Montana, and that we can give
in general terms, though without being able to locate the
exact parts done by individuals, the names of the authors
of two volumes of Central America, and all of Mexico,
Utah, British Columbia, and Alaska. In these works
Oak and Nemos were agreed that there were scattered
fragmentary bits aggregating several volumes so worked
over by different writers in different ways as to render it
impossible to determine the exact authorship.</p>

<p>Turning to a consideration of the individual field of
writing, we find that of the twenty-eight volumes of history
proper, Bancroft is to be credited with four, no one
entire, Oak with seven and a half, Nemos five, no one
entire, Mrs. Victor a little less than five, Savage over
three, Peatfield one and a half, principally in small parts,
and Bates one and a fourth. (This is a computation
based exactly upon the facts as given, except in Bancroft's
case.) Nemos upon the same basis makes the
shares, except Savage's and Bancroft's, all slightly
greater. He assigns to Oak between seven and a half
and seven and two thirds volumes, to himself and Mrs.
Victor over five each, to Peatfield about two, and to
Bates one and a half. An actual count of the parts of
volumes written by Bancroft gives a total of three and a
half, but Nemos said that he took four as the number
upon the authority of Oak. This would allow him a half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
volume of interpolations in the twenty-four and a half
volumes done by others. Griffin, Petroff, Kuhn, and a
man named Rasmus were the authors of fragments. Oak
thought that the name was Erasmus, but said that Nemos
who gave Rasmus was the better authority.</p>

<p>Concerning these facts in their main features, there is
a complete agreement between Oak and Nemos, who
together knew all the details which were to be known,
and the evidence of the other writers fits exactly with
their statements. The popular estimate of Hubert Howe
Bancroft as the historian of the Pacific Coast, is founded
upon the vague references and indefinite assertions of the
Literary Industries within the pages of which there is
nowhere to be found a straightforward statement that
this man wrote more than a part of the works to which
his name is attached. On the other hand, his own statements
over his own signature admit that he did not pretend
to be the author of what went out under his name.
The ranking of Mr. Bancroft among historians of the
United States is, therefore, an error, and what has appeared
in the public press concerning an "Historian of
the Pacific Coast," and a "Macaulay of the West," is
legend pure and simple. Instead of one Pacific Coast
historian who wrote the Bancroft volumes, there were
eight.</p>

<p>As to the six supplementary volumes of the "Works
of Hubert Howe Bancroft," which ended the series, Mrs.
Victor had some means of determining the authorship.
According to her notes, Savage and Nemos did a great
deal of writing and revising. The Modoc War in <i>inter pocula</i>,
a part of the chapter entitled Some Indian Episodes,
was written by Mrs. Victor from notes obtained
by herself on the ground. She also wrote some other
matter for this volume. The remainder was done by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
Bancroft and his family, who also aided him much on
Popular Tribunals.</p>

<p>Pastorals was produced chiefly by Bancroft. Of the
Literary Industries, Nemos wrote several chapters or
parts, Savage a little, and Oak three or four bits of a few
paragraphs each. It must be remembered that Bancroft's
writing in these private volumes was subjected to
criticism, revision, and retouching by the best literary
talent which the library afforded.</p>

<p>Concerning the Chronicles of the Builders, the biographical
series which followed the histories, with such
unfortunate results, some notes in Mrs. Victor's handwriting
taken in 1888, about a year before work finally
ended, give us the following facts: The introductory
essay is by Nemos, as are also the reflective chapters and
reviews, together with most of the historical text. Peatfield
wrote Oregon, Washington, and Texas, though some
of the latter was rewritten by Nemos. Mrs. Victor wrote
"Routes and Transportation," and a number of the leading
biographies, making nearly a volume. Savage wrote
about a third of a volume.</p>

<p>Mr. Bancroft as a writer of history was subject to certain
influences likely to be felt in his treatment of facts,
which did not affect his coworkers. One great object was
of course to make the work popular. It was with this
end in view that much attention was given to literary
finish and typographical features. It was his practice
to have a writer employed for the purpose go over his
own manuscripts and sometimes those of his assistants
to add "classical allusions," as he termed them, for rhetorical
effect. He himself was given to the reading of
English classics&mdash;Carlyle's works are especially mentioned
by his friends&mdash;as a means of acquiring a good
literary style. To stimulate the reader's attention, he
occasionally made a side remark of such a ludicrous character
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
as to be startling when one comes upon it in a perfectly
serious paragraph. Mrs. Victor often laughed over
the interlineation in a paragraph written by her on the
Oregon boundary question of the words:</p>

<p>"Man is a preposterous pig; probably the greediest
animal that crawls upon this planet": (Oregon, I, 592.)</p>

<p>In passing upon the work of his corps of writers, one
who combined the duties of financier as well as editor of
the work either consciously or unconsciously must have
been influenced by the question whether the treatment
of the subject before him was such as would please the
people in the locality whose history was being written.
The Mormon turn given the History of Utah by the toning
down of certain incidents which other historians have
"shrunk from contemplating" occurs to us as a case in
point: (Frances Fuller Victor in <i>Salt Lake Tribune</i>, April
14, 1893; <i>New York Mail and Express</i>, November 23d).</p>

<p>The publication of the Chronicles before all of the volumes
of history were out could hardly have lessened this
tendency, as a favorable mention of a man in the history
would naturally tend to make him more approachable
upon the subject of contributing to that work. Upon the
back of the letter to Mrs. Victor instructing her to give
prominence to certain dictations, which he admits are
practically worthless, is written in her hand the legend,
"Ways that are dark and tricks that are vain." As a result
of complaint, changes were sometimes made in the
text, even after the first edition was out: (Pamphlet,
Proceedings of the Society of California Pioneers in Reference
to the Histories of Hubert Howe Bancroft).</p>

<p>In the History of Montana occurs an example of a
change made directly for business reasons. Several pioneers
justly entitled to a place in the history of their territory
disagreed with the agent of the Bancroft house concerning
the number of volumes of the history which their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
contract required them to take. As a punishment for
their refusal to comply with the demands of the publisher,
their biographies were stricken from their place
in the footnotes after the volume was set up, and other
matter was substituted. (The original sheets with marginal
annotations as to amounts paid and biographies to
be omitted are in the possession of Mr. E. H. Kilham of
Portland, Oregon.) In view of these facts, we are forced
to conclude that the business man in Mr. Bancroft, developed
by the experiences and associations of a lifetime,
sometimes got the better of the historical editor of scarcely
fifteen years' standing.</p>

<p>A second factor to be considered in Mr. Bancroft's
writing was sometimes expressed by his acquaintances as
a mistaking of contrariness for originality. As already
indicated, his tendency is toward a form of writing such
as will attract the reader's attention. This tendency
frequently asserts itself in sweeping statements and striking
characterizations, many of them apparently impelled
by a desire to give a turn to an incident or an estimate
of a character different from that given by any previous
writer. Thus Bancroft wrote an estimate of General
Grant, which was startling because of the general hostility
of its tone, and was considered so unjust by Mrs.
Victor and Oak that they persuaded him to leave it out.
(Letter of Mrs. Victor of July 25, 1892. The paragraph
which was originally intended as a footnote in the History
of Oregon, II, 246, is printed on page 18 of the
Pamphlet of the Society of California Pioneers, which
gives their proceedings with reference to Bancroft's histories.)</p>

<p>Again, in making an effort to avoid following Washington
Irving, he has given in the part of the Northwest
Coast which he wrote a treatment of the Astor enterprise,
and an estimate of the character of Captain Bonneville,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
which later historians have shown to be prejudiced
and in error. (See Chittenden's History of the American
Fur Trade in the Far West, I, 432-33.)</p>

<p>A third influence affecting the treatment of facts of history
which passed under Mr. Bancroft's editorship, as
well as those which he presented in the scattered portions
of volumes of which he could claim real authorship, is
that of personal bias. The manager of the Bancroft enterprise
was a man, who in the course of a thirty years'
business career had many business rivalries and personal
enmities. His strong dislikes frequently assert themselves
in his writings, if we are to take his own statements.
(Lit. Ind., 374.)</p>

<p>Again, the personal equation must be accounted for in
the value which he sets on the work of historians who
wrote before him. He not infrequently disparages their
writings in the strongest terms, his depreciation of Washington
Irving being one of the most palpable cases.
(Chittenden's History of American Fur Trade in the Far
West, I, 244-46), has forcibly revealed the extent of the
injustice done by Bancroft in this one case. That there
are others like it will readily appear. For the effort to
demonstrate the superiority of the Bancroft histories over
others, we must accordingly make due allowance when
attempting a critical estimate.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the editor-manager began the work with
certain theories and notions of history that have found
their way into the pages which he has published. From
the beginning, he adopted the British side in dealing
with the dispute over the Oregon boundary. In his
treatment of Indian wars, the same tendency to adopt
ready-made theories asserted itself. In the manuscript
of Mrs. Victor's History of Oregon, treating of Indian
Wars in Southern Oregon which "gave great credit to the
veterans of that struggle and the settlers generally for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
their forbearance," the editor interlined some expressions,
throwing the blame upon the settlers. When it
was pointed out to him that this was not true, he replied
that he had begun his History of Central America with
this theory of Indian wars, and must be consistent
throughout the entire series (Communication of Frances
Fuller Victor to the [Salem] <i>Oregon Statesman</i>, February
24, 1895).</p>

<p>To such errors as those just enumerated the work of
Mr. Bancroft's collaborators was not subject. The dislike
inspired by some of the measures of their chief has
sometimes resulted in their disparagement as historians
by a public press, absolutely ignorant of the parts of the
work for which they were responsible. (In the <i>Salt Lake
Tribune</i>, February 16, 1893, is a very striking example.
Occasional utterances of the San Francisco papers of
about the same time follow along the same line.) It
must be remembered that they were not only able and
educated, but that the competitive wage system under
which they worked offered every inducement to search
for the truth and to make it known as they found it in
the best collection of books, pamphlets, and newspapers
on Pacific Coast history that was ever made. The only
characteristics which were common to the library corps,
as shown by a study of their biographies, were good
education, ill health, and liberal religious views.</p>

<p>In general, these writers had special qualifications
which adapted them for work in their respective fields.
To Oak there was a fascination in the study of documents
from which the usually uninteresting and sometimes
tedious details of events in Spanish and Mexican provincial
localities were derived. His contributions to history
he could honestly claim were better than other writings
on the same subject because of the exhaustiveness of his
research through the great amount of material at his disposal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
While he admired the finer qualities of style in
the writings of others, they were not required in his work.
He frankly declared that he had little natural ability in
this line, and in the writing of provincial annals found
no opportunity for the cultivation of what he had. Oak
once asserted in a joking mood that he had found of great
service a thorough knowledge of Spanish and French,
together with a useful smattering of other languages, including
English. None of his chapters were rewritten
or even reread with a view to polish, for the reason that
he believed his works had their chief value merely as
records, and that an attempt to make them fascinating to
general readers could but result in impairing their value
for reference. The fact that the superintendent of literary
activities in the Bancroft library was an enthusiast
in original research who cared vastly more what was said
than how it was said is a circumstance favoring the accuracy
of the histories which must not be overlooked.
Oak could say that from the first he had exercised an
important influence in the direction of honest research
and against superficial work, and that he opposed undue
haste in bringing the work to a conclusion.</p>

<p>Nemos, unlike Oak, was a writer of smooth, flowing
English. On account of his foreign birth he had no
preference in the selection of a field, and wrote for more
different volumes than any other member of the library
force. His great ability, and his consequent position of
all-round man, are to be accounted for by great natural
endowment supplemented by a thorough training in
youth in his own country, a schooling during his London
residence in the philosophy of his own country as well as
that of the German universities, and a wide acquaintance
with European languages. With a remarkable faculty
for systematizing work, he was useful, honorable, and
trustworthy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span></p>

<p>To Mrs. Victor was assigned the agreeable task of working
up the field in which she had long taken special interest.
She was the only member of the staff who had
a literary reputation before entering the library. Noted
as a poetess of unusual promise in her earlier days, she
had also written excellent prose for different journals,
among them a magazine history of the United States published
in serial form by the Harpers, until the beginning
of the Civil War compelled the discontinuance of the
publication in which it appeared. As a contributor to
the San Francisco papers in the early "sixties," she had
met with pronounced success, while her work on her projected
History of Oregon and her publication of two works
on the Northwest fitted her for her special field. She
had the enviable faculty of putting life into her writings,
and it was partially on account of her graceful style that
Mr. Bancroft sought her services, for his eye was always
attracted by good literary work. But the volumes written
by Mrs. Victor were of a far different stamp from the
popular literary history. The late Mary Sheldon Barnes,
professor of history in Stanford University, declared that
she had done her work well. All who were acquainted
with her personally recognized the fact that she placed
the truth as she conceived it before all else. The leading
opponents of the stand she took on disputed questions
freely recognized the fact that she had striven to do conscientious,
painstaking work. Given to speaking what
she believed was the whole truth, even when it was contrary
to her immediate interest to do so, she was the last
of all persons whom a regard for literary effect would
swerve from the path of historical accuracy.</p>

<p>A better man for chief Spanish authority than Thomas
Savage could scarcely have been found. Thoroughly
acquainted with the language by a life-long residence in
Spanish America, he had a natural fondness for history,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
to which his long continuance in the consular service had
added a habit of accuracy, and a capacity for hard work.
The fifth volume of the History of Mexico, embracing the
history of that country from 1824 to 1861, and the third
volume of the Central American history which threads
out the tangled skein of the history of the five little republics
in the nineteenth century, serve as examples of
the vast amount of detail which his writing covered, to
say nothing of his labors in collecting and extracting an
overwhelming mass of material on Spanish American
history. All agree that he was a polished and sound
man.</p>

<p>In the writers of smaller parts of the history, we find
that the qualifications and fitness for the individual field
of writing were no less than in those who prepared more
manuscript. Peatfield's connection with the British
consular service bespeaks his reliability and capability;
Bates' occupancy of a responsible position under a prominent
English educator, and the high regard in which his
work was held by Hittell bear witness that he was competent
to write history; and Petroff's standing as a scholar
in his own country, together with his thorough acquaintance
with Alaska, vouch for the character of his work.</p>

<p>While the Bancroft corps of writers were not infallible,
they were a class of persons in whose integrity and accuracy
we may have as great confidence as in the average
historian. We can only regret that we can not point out
all parts of the work done by each, and that we can not
show in detail the extent of Mr. Bancroft's editorial
alterations of their work. This latter feature, inherent
in the Bancroft plan of writing history, is its greatest
weakness, since it of necessity involves some uncertainty
as to whether the words we are reading are those of the
author who wrote the volume, or the interpretation of
Mr. Bancroft. A comparative study of the style of what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
we know to be the work of the respective writers may
suffice to settle a given case. We may state as a fact
that the majority of alterations in the manuscripts of the
chief assistants were due to the necessity of condensation;
and that, aside from this, the revision of their
work usually consisted merely in the suppression of
radical utterances and the interlineation of a few lines
occasionally for literary effect. The somewhat rough
estimate given of the number of volumes written by the respective
writers indicates that Mr. Bancroft's revisions
constitute about one page in fifty of the work in fields
assigned to his assistants, although the average may be
lower. In view of these facts, the knowledge that those
who wrote the Bancroft histories were capable, honest
persons, must tend decidedly toward the increasing of
our general confidence in the series.</p>

<h3>PIONEER PAPERS OF PUGET SOUND.</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span></p>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Clarence B. Bagley</span>.</p>

<p>The trapper, the trader, the missionary, and the printer
were the pioneers of "Old Oregon," as the original territory
lying between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific
Ocean, and extending northward from California to the
British possessions may be properly called. A mere
handful of patriotic Americans founded a provisional
government for this vast wilderness in 1843, and the
American Government enclosed it safely in the national
fold in 1846 by treaty with Great Britain, and organized
it into a territory August 14, 1848.</p>

<p>Those who are the leading spirits in the several historical
societies of the Northwest, and the writers of its
history, realize the true value to be placed upon the labors
of the pioneer printers and newspaper men of "Old Oregon."
This expression is tautological. There were no
newspaper men who were not printers in the pioneer
days.</p>

<p>It has been my good fortune, as child, boy, and man,
to know nearly all the old newspaper men of Oregon and
Washington of that period by sight, and to be on terms of
friendship with most of them, as well as most intimate
with the majority. Among them were:</p>

<p>Ashael Bush, W. L. Adams, Thomas H. Pearne, T. J.
Dryer, Harvey W. Scott, H. L. Pittock, Beriah Brown,
James O'Meara, W. Lair Hill, Wm. G. T'Vault, Samuel
A. Clarke, Mrs. Duniway, D. W. Craig, John Atkinson,
E. M. Waite, L. Samuels, John Burnett, J. M. Baltimore,
William Newell, P. B. Johnson, R. R. Rees, E. T. Gunn,
Charles Besserer, Eugene Semple, A. M. Poe, John Miller
Murphy, Randall H. Hewitt, L. G. Abbott, Thornton F.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
McElroy, James N. Gale, J. R. Watson, David Higgins,
Charles and Thomas W. Prosch, John F. Damon, D. C.
Ireland, Francis H. Cook, S. L. Maxwell, H. C. Patrick,
R. F. Radebaugh, and many of their contemporaries, as
well as a host of their successors.</p>

<p>Nearly all these were practical printers, and most of
them skillful at the case, capable of taking entire charge
of the mechanical department of the early day printing
offices.</p>

<p>This training made them accurate in their literary
work. While some of them might not have been on intimate
terms with the rules of grammar, they made up for
any such deficiency by untiring and conscientious efforts
to give their readers good newspapers, in the face of the
gravest difficulties. In the matter of politics full allowance
had ever to be made for the personal bias of the
writer, but in the matter of news, especially that of a
local character, the most absolute fidelity to the truth
was ever maintained. No efforts were made for a "good
story" at the expense of truth. The head of the paper
always had a personal knowledge of the facts and usually
prepared the account of them. If he found he had made a
mistake he usually corrected it in the next issue, if it was
of sufficient importance. For this reason the writer of the
present day who delves among the old newspaper files of
pioneer days, and even down to within twenty or twenty-five
years ago, can rely upon the fairness and truthfulness
of their local columns. They were all writing history but
few of them realized it.</p>

<p>Life was too strenuous with the pioneers of the "forties"
and "fifties" for them to spend much time in keeping
diaries or other records of passing events. If they
had done so, the unsettled conditions under which they
lived, the lack of substantial buildings, the migration to
new countries, and the rush to new mines, would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
resulted in the loss or destruction of most of such manuscripts.</p>

<p>Of the early Oregon papers, I doubt if more than two
or three perfect files exist. Of the early papers of Washington,
not more than three or four complete files remain
of any of them. Of the first Seattle papers, there is but
one file. It I began collecting more than forty years ago.
How much care, then, should be exercised in gathering
these old papers from the garrets and the closets where
they have lain fifty years or more, perhaps&mdash;as well as to
observe the most painstaking care for their preservation.</p>

<p>When the missions among the Indians of Oregon were
established by Messrs. Whitman and Spalding in 1836,
the First Native Church of Honolulu decided to send
to it a small printing press and some type and material
that had been in use for some time there in printing
spelling books and religious matter, thinking the work of
the mission in Oregon would be advanced by its aid.</p>

<p>Edwin O. Hall had been one of the printers of the
Honolulu mission and he was engaged to accompany the
printing outfit to Oregon. With the press, type, fixtures,
a stock of paper and binding apparatus in his charge he,
accompanied by his wife, arrived at Vancouver, on the
Columbia River, early in the month of April, 1839. In
a few days the press and party started up the Columbia
River in a canoe and reached Wallula on the 30th. From
there the press was sent on pack animals to Lapwai, on
the Clearwater River, not far from the present City of
Lewiston, Idaho, while the rest of the outfit and the
party went on up the river by canoe.</p>

<p>May 18, 1839, the first proof sheet in the original Oregon
Territory was struck off amid great rejoicing among
the missionary party. A large number of publications
in the Flathead, Spokane, Cayuse, and Nez Percé language
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
was printed by the mission people. In fact, the
press was in use a great deal until in 1846, when Doctor
Whitman sent it to The Dalles, where it remained until
after the Whitman massacre, November 29-30, 1847.</p>

<p>In 1848 it was in use near Hillsboro, on Tualatin Plains,
for several months, where eight numbers of the <i>Oregon
American and Evangelical Unionist</i> appeared, which was
the third paper in chronological order.</p>

<p>By this time more modern presses, apparatus and types
had reached Oregon and the pioneer outfit was laid
aside. Years later it came into the possession of the
Oregon Historical Society at Portland.</p>

<p>The <i>Oregon Spectator</i> was the first newspaper in Old
Oregon, and the initial number appeared at Oregon City
on Thursday, February 5, 1846. A new plant had been
procured for it in New York, whence it was sent around
"The Horn." Col. William G. T'Vault was its editor
and John Flemming the printer. This paper passed
through many vicissitudes in the ensuing years&mdash;numerous
changes of editors and publishers with frequent alterations
in size, now larger and again smaller, until it
finally suspended in 1855.</p>

<p>The second paper was the <i>Oregon Free Press</i>, which appeared
in March, 1848, under the control of George L.
Curry, who later became Governor of Oregon.</p>

<p>The fourth in order was the <i>Western Star</i>, first issued
at Milwaukie November 21, 1850, by Lot Whitcomb. At
that time Milwaukie, on the east side of the Willamette,
a few miles above Portland, was a rival of the latter place
for commercial supremacy, but in May, 1851, Milwaukie
had fallen behind in the race, and the <i>Star</i> was moved to
Portland, and its name changed to the <i>Oregon Weekly
Times</i>. It lived much longer than most of the early
newspaper ventures of the Northwest. Among its numerous
editors were A. C. Gibbs, Governor of Oregon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
during the Civil War period, and also W. Lair Hill, with
whom all lawyers of Oregon and Washington are familiar
personally or by reputation. He was the author of the
well-known code of this state bearing his name, and for
a considerable period a resident of Seattle.</p>

<p>The fifth was the <i>Weekly Oregonian</i> and the only one of
all the newspapers of Oregon and Washington appearing
prior to 1860 to survive with its original name and without
periodical suspensions.</p>

<p>The <i>Oregonian</i> had to struggle for existence during all
its early years. Rivals unnumbered went to the newspaper
graveyard during the succeeding quarter century.
It is a conservative estimate to place the aggregate at a
$1,000,000 sunk during that period by ambitious printers,
dissatisfied politicians, and by corporations who could
not control its editorials, in the various attempts to break
the <i>Oregonian</i> down. The most notable contest was between
the <i>Oregonian</i> and the <i>Bulletin</i>, when Ben. Holladay
was the great magnate in railroad and steamship
affairs of the Northwest. He established, about 1872, a
first-class newspaper and job printing office that cost not
less than $50,000. He employed the best newspaper
talent he could secure, and the <i>Bulletin</i> at once became a
dangerous rival for the <i>Oregonian</i>, which had to depend
solely on its own resources for its support, while the
weekly deficit in the <i>Bulletin</i> office was made good by a
check from Ben. Holladay.</p>

<p>The <i>Oregonian</i> had at that time about seven thousand
subscribers at $3 per year to its weekly paper, while the
<i>Bulletin</i> had only a few hundred. The <i>Weekly Oregonian</i>
saved the day, and the <i>Bulletin</i> died the death. Its backer
is reputed to have sunk not less than $100,000. This left
the <i>Oregonian</i> master of the field, and it became the overshadowing
journalistic power of the Northwest until the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
great dailies of Seattle forced it to the rear in the State
of Washington.</p>

<p>Thomas J. Dryer was its first editor and A. M. Berry
the first printer. Henry L. Pittock became a printer in
its office in November, 1853, and was admitted to partnership
in 1856, and only four years later became its sole
owner. Mr. Harvey W. Scott went on its editorial staff
in May, 1865. In 1877 he bought an interest in the paper
and became editor-in-chief. He and Mr. Pittock still own
the paper, and it need not be added that it has made them
immensely wealthy.</p>

<p>The <i>Daily Oregonian</i> made its first appearance February
4, 1861. It consisted of four pages, each page about
11½x18 inches, four columns to the page.</p>

<p>March 26, 1851, the <i>Oregon Statesman</i> was launched on
the newspaper sea at Salem, the state capital, with Joseph
S. Smith at the helm. In later years Smith went to Congress
from that state and was always a conspicuous figure
in Democratic circles. In September, 1852, when we arrived
in Salem from across "the plains," Asahel Bush
had become owner and editor. He soon became public
printer, then an exceedingly profitable billet, and in six
or eight years was quite wealthy. The <i>Statesman</i> was the
leading Democratic journal for a long period and wielded
a powerful influence until Joseph Lane and the Democratic
party under him lost the state, when Abraham
Lincoln was elected President. After that its influence
gradually declined. It underwent the usual changes of
ownership and temporary suspensions.</p>

<p>It will be difficult for the younger men in the newspaper
offices of today, with their many departments and
special work, to realize the many cares and duties devolving
upon the pioneer newspaper men. The successful
one was a capable printer who could "set type," run a
press, make up the forms, make a roller, and wash it if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
need be. He was editorial writer, local reporter, business
manager, and mailing clerk. A "job office" was
usually a part of the printing establishment and he, perforce,
must be his own job printer and pressman as well.</p>

<p>During all the earlier years there were no telegraphic
dispatches, the "news" being selected from the weekly
issues of the <i>Tribune</i> or <i>Herald</i> of New York City, which
came by mail steamer to the Isthmus of Panama, thence
across and by steamer to San Francisco, and thence with
the utmost irregularity by steamer to Portland, from
there down the Columbia and up the Cowlitz River and
by pack animal or mud wagon to Olympia.</p>

<p>Under all these adverse circumstances it is remarkable
what good newspapers were issued. They were usually
on paper 24x36 inches in size, which was about the limit
for hand presses then in use. The editorial matter was
vigorous and able, the typography and presswork equal
to that of the present day, the selection of news and
literary matter unexceptionable. It is not a matter of
surprise that men capable of accomplishing such good
work in the face of such difficulties should have wielded
a powerful influence in the pioneer work of the territory.</p>

<p>Of the pioneer newspaper men of Oregon and Washington
there are many in Seattle. First in age and experience
is Charles Prosch, with over forty years to his
credit. Rev. John F. Damon comes next in seniority of
service. Judge Orange Jacobs had much editorial experience
in Oregon before coming here. Henry G. Struve,
Esq., was an editorial writer for years prior to 1873, in
Vancouver, Clarke County, and in Olympia. Ex-Governor
Semple spent many years in all kinds of newspaper
work in Oregon and Washington, beginning about 1870.
Thomas W. Prosch learned to be a printer as he learned
to read on the <i>Herald</i> at Steilacoom and the <i>Tribune</i> in
Olympia. C. B. Bagley began newspaper work in 1868
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
and continued it with little intermission for twenty years.
Samuel C. Crawford began as printer's devil for John
Miller Murphy on the Olympia <i>Standard</i> thirty years or
more ago. Beriah Brown, the senior of them all, recently
died here, and his son Berry began "at the case"
and other newspaper work as early as 1868.</p>

<p>The <i>Columbian</i> was the "pioneer newspaper west of the
mountains, between the father of Oregon waters and
Kamstkatka," as an editorial paragraph in the first number
puts it. Messrs. Wiley &amp; McElroy established it in
Olympia September 11, 1852. Later its name was
changed to the <i>Pioneer</i>, and not long afterward it was
merged with the <i>Democrat</i>, a rival paper, under the name
of <i>Pioneer and Democrat</i>. From the above date Olympia
has never been without one or more weekly papers, and
at times has enjoyed two daily papers at the same time.</p>

<p>The <i>Puget Sound Courier</i> was the pioneer paper at Steilacoom,
which was started by Affleck &amp; Gunn, May 19,
1854. It was Whig in politics, and as the population
was overwhelmingly Democratic it soon died for lack of
sustenance.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Prosch, the dean of newspaperdom on
Puget Sound, whose erect form and snow-white hair are
familiar on the streets of Seattle, published the <i>Puget
Sound Herald</i> at Steilacoom, beginning March 12, 1858,
for about six years, and later other papers at Olympia.</p>

<p>The <i>Northern Light</i> appeared at Whatcom in 1858, under
the management of W. Bausman &amp; Co., during a few
weeks of the height of the Fraser River gold rush, but
its light was soon snuffed out.</p>

<p>The <i>Port Townsend Register</i> was started January 4, 1860,
by a young man named Travers Daniels, but the field
was not an encouraging one, and at the end of ten weeks
he sold out to William T. Whitacre, who kept it alive
until August, when it suspended.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span></p>

<p>July 5 of the same year the <i>Northwest</i> was started in
Port Townsend by E. S. Dyer, publisher, and John F.
Damon, editor. Mr. Damon continued with the paper
until it suspended, before the second volume was completed.</p>

<p>Rev. John F. Damon, the Congregational clergyman
of Seattle, is too widely known to require extended mention
here.</p>

<p>The <i>Register</i> was resuscitated late in 1860 and run a
violent career for several months, and later was followed
by the <i>Message</i>, which ran several years under different
management.</p>

<p>In 1874 C. W. Philbrick purchased the press on which
the last-named paper was printed, changed the name to
<i>Puget Sound Argus</i>, and succeeded in placing it on a paying
basis, a hitherto impossible achievement in Port
Townsend. In 1877 Philbrick, after accumulating considerable
property, sold the <i>Argus</i> to Mr. Allen Weir.</p>

<p>July 29, 1861, the <i>Overland Press</i> was started in Olympia.
A short time before the pony express had been put on the
route between the Missouri River and Sacramento, carrying
the news and a few letters, thus placing San Francisco
and New York in communication with each other
in from ten to twelve days. This suggested the name of
the paper. It was enabled to give a brief summary of
Eastern news only three weeks old. Prior to this it had
been from six weeks to three months old when it reached
Olympia.</p>

<p>The great Civil War had broken out only a few weeks
earlier and the manager of the <i>Press</i> of Victoria, British
Columbia, with commendable business sagacity, determined
to establish a paper in Olympia containing the
latest war news, and have it ready to distribute at all
Puget Sound ports and have a supply to distribute to its
own readers in Victoria and other parts of British Columbia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
on the arrival of the weekly mail. The Eliza Anderson,
then the crack steamer of Puget Sound waters, made
weekly trips, leaving Olympia early on Monday morning,
arriving at Seattle about 4 <span class="s08">P. M.</span>, and at Victoria early
Tuesday morning. The paper at once became very popular
and gained an immense circulation for those days.</p>

<p>Early in the fourth volume its name was changed to
the <i>Pacific Tribune</i>. Randall H. Hewitt, now living in
Los Angeles, owned and published it for a time, when
Charles Prosch acquired it and continued its publication
at Olympia until 1873. By this time his son, Thomas
W. Prosch, had manifested much newspaper ability and
had become the owner of the paper. He moved it to
Tacoma, the new railroad town, that year and continued
there until the almost total death of the place forced another
move and he came to Seattle with it. In 1878
Thaddeus Hanford bought it and merged it with the <i>Post-Intelligencer</i>.
With but one change of name it had lived
about seventeen years, or longer than any other of the
early Washington papers, with one exception.</p>

<p>This exception was and is the <i>Washington Standard</i> of
Olympia, the most notable instance of newspaper longevity,
with the exception of the <i>Oregonian</i>, in old Oregon.
Its first number was largely written, set up and
printed by its founder, John Miller Murphy, and now,
almost forty-three years later, it is his proud boast that
it has never missed an issue, has never changed its name
and that not a single one of its weekly issues has failed
to have more or less editorial matter from his pen. It
was "Union" in sentiment during the war of the rebellion,
but espoused the cause of Andrew Johnson in his
contest with a Republican Congress, and since then has
always been consistently Democratic. Mr. Murphy has
always been too proud of his independence to subordinate
his will or the expressions of his journal to the control
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
of his party leaders, and has often refused preferment at
their hands on that account. He still superintends the
mechanical department of his office, as well as attending
to his editorial duties. He had achieved a competence
but the panic of 1893 and the ensuing period of financial
depression made great inroads upon his fortune, so that
necessity compels him to remain in the harness, though
nearly a half century of continuous work has certainly
earned him rest.</p>

<p>The <i>Seattle Gazette</i> was the name under which the first
paper published in Seattle appeared, dated December 11,
1863, nearly forty years ago. It was edited, set up, published,
and with the assistance of an Indian for roller boy,
printed by J. R. Watson. The office was in the second
story of one of Yesler's buildings, then standing near the
present north line of the Scandinavian Bank Building.
The paper consisted of four pages, the printed matter
on each page measuring 9½x14½ inches. The type and
other material were destroyed many years ago, but the
old Ramage<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> printing press is a relic highly prized at the
State University. The <i>Seattle Gazette</i>, <i>Puget Sound Gazette</i>,
and <i>Puget Sound Weekly</i> continued nearly four years with
frequent changes in form and ownership.</p>

<p>Pioneer printers have taken a great deal of interest in
regard to the antecedents of this old press. Mr. George
H. Himes was an Olympia boy, who served his apprenticeship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
in the office of the <i>Washington Standard</i> under
John Miller Murphy. From there he went to Portland
and in time "Himes the Printer" became a household
word in Oregon and Washington. He has of late years
been prominent in the pioneer and historical societies of
Oregon. He has given much time to research regarding
this old press, and as a result gives it as his opinion that
it was first sent from New York to Mexico, thence to Monterey,
California, in 1834, where it was used by the Spanish
governor for a number of years in printing proclamations,
etc., and on August 15, 1846, the <i>Californian</i>, the
pioneer paper of California, was printed on it. Late in
1846 it was sent from Monterey to San Francisco and
used in printing the <i>Star</i>, the first paper of that city, issued
in January, 1847. These two papers were combined at
a later date, and in the fall of 1848 the first number of
the <i>Alta California</i> was issued from it. From San Francisco
it went to Portland and the first number of the <i>Oregonian</i>
was taken off it. In 1852 it and the old plant
of the <i>Oregonian</i> was bought by Thornton F. McElroy
and J. W. Wiley, who brought it around on the schooner
Mary Taylor to Olympia, where the first number of the
<i>Columbian</i> was printed on it. In 1863 J. R. Watson
brought it to Seattle, and December 10th the first paper,
the Seattle <i>Gazette</i>, was printed on it. Again in 1865
S. L. Maxwell used it to print the earlier numbers of the
<i>Intelligencer</i>.</p>

<p>There seems to be no doubt that it was used to print
the first newspapers on the Pacific Coast, the first in Monterey,
San Francisco, Portland, Olympia, Seattle.</p>

<p>Although Seattle's first paper was of much more modest
proportions than any of its predecessors or contemporaries,
it had the honor of starting the first daily paper
in the territory, which appeared April 23, 1866, and continued
to August 11th of the same year.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span></p>

<p>The Western Union Telegraph line was completed to
Seattle October 26, 1864, and at 4 <span class="s08">P. M.</span> of that date the
<i>Gazette</i> issued its "Citizen's Dispatch," giving the first
published dispatch coming by wire to this place. It gave
the Eastern war news to October 24th, from Kansas
City and from Chattanooga of the operations of Sherman
against Hood in the Atlanta campaign.</p>

<p>Occasionally telegraphic dispatches appeared in succeeding
papers, but not until about July 1, 1872, when the
<i>Puget Sound Dispatch</i> was established by Larrabee &amp; Co.,
Beriah Brown, editor, was any regular publication of the
press dispatches undertaken here.</p>

<p>In June, 1867, a suspension took place, and August 5th
next S. L. Maxwell sent to press the first number of the
<i>Weekly Intelligencer</i>. The plant had come into the ownership
of Messrs. Daniel and C. B. Bagley, and Mr. Maxwell
was permitted to use the same and pay for it as he
could out of the earnings of the paper. The type, rules,
press, and much of the advertising matter of the older
paper, still standing in the forms, was used in the makeup
of the new paper, so that it may properly be considered
a lineal successor of the <i>Seattle Gazette</i>. Mr. Maxwell
proved to be a good newspaper and business man, and as
the town and surrounding country was having a vigorous
growth, it did not take him long to pay off the small debt
and to add much needed material to the office, which was
moved across Yesler Way to a small wooden building,
and, later, up Yesler Way to near the southwest corner of
Second Avenue South. It gained influence as it grew,
made money for its owner almost from the start, and had
the local field to itself until the <i>Dispatch</i> was started.</p>

<p>In the latter part of 1878 some of the prominent local
office-holders and business men organized a company to
start another paper, and November 21, 1878, the <i>Seattle
Weekly Post</i> made its first appearance, being made up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
from the <i>Daily Post</i>, which started on the 15th of the
month. Its first quarters were in the two-story wooden
building owned by Hillory Butler that stood on the ground
now occupied by the southwest corner of the Hotel Butler.
In passing it may be added that this building was, from
time to time, the home of more early papers than any
other in town&mdash;<i>Dispatch</i>, <i>North Pacific Rural</i>, <i>Chronicle</i>,
<i>Post</i>, <i>Times</i>, <i>Press</i>, and others with single and hyphenated
titles long since forgotten.</p>

<p>In the meantime the <i>Intelligencer</i> had been installed in
a larger two-story building then standing on the west
side of First Avenue where it deflects into First Avenue
South, and remained there several years.</p>

<p>About 1879 Thomas W. Prosch and Samuel L. Crawford
had acquired ownership of it. Both had been printers
from boyhood, and Mr. Prosch had gained much experience
as a newspaper man in Olympia and Tacoma, and
under their management it continued to grow in value
and influence.</p>

<p>In 1881 the Post Publishing Company began the erection
of a substantial brick building, two stories and basement
on the northeast corner of Yesler Way and Post
Street. As it was nearing completion negotiations were
opened for a consolidation of the <i>Post</i> and <i>Intelligencer</i>,
and this was effected October 1, 1881, with Thomas W.
Prosch owner of one half and John Leary and George
W. Harris each one quarter. The basement and lower
story of the new building were used by the company and
the upper story rented for offices.</p>

<p>This building continued to be the home of the paper
under several managements, until the great fire of June
6, 1889, destroyed it and most of its plant.</p>

<p>Early in 1886 a joint stock company, consisting of Frederick
J. Grant, C. B. Bagley, Griffith Davies, Jacob Furth,
John H. McGraw, E. S. Ingraham, W. H. Hughes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
Thomas Burke, and Dr. Thomas T. Miner, bought the <i>Post-Intelligencer</i>
from T. W. Prosch. Grant continued editor-in-chief,
Bagley was business manager, S. L. Crawford
city editor and reporter, and E. S. Meany had charge of
the carrier service.</p>

<p>Near the close of the same year L. S. J. Hunt purchased
the controlling interest in the paper and assumed management
at once. He had come to Seattle with large
financial backing, determined to go into the newspaper
field, and the majority of the stockholders, fearing he
might establish another paper and make it a powerful
rival, sold him their interests. He proceeded to spend
money most lavishly upon it and soon built it up into a
great paper.</p>

<p>In May, 1871, a small printing outfit that had been in
use at Sitka, Alaska, was brought to Seattle, and for a
few months the <i>Seattle Times and Alaska Herald</i> was printed
from it.</p>

<p>Later this material became the nucleus of the office of
the <i>Puget Sound Dispatch</i>, which was established by Beriah
Brown and Charles H. Larrabee. The latter was then a
prominent attorney in Seattle. He was among the killed
at the time of an appalling tragedy at Tehachipe Pass,
on the line of the Southern Pacific, between Los Angeles
and San Francisco. He soon retired from the paper,
leaving Beriah Brown in sole control, which he retained
with an occasional intermission until about 1878, when
it was merged with the <i>Intelligencer</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown was one of the old school newspapermen,
who were writers of editorials worthy of the greatest
papers of the United States. He was a friend of Horace
Greeley, the elder Bennett and others of the noted editors
of a half century ago. He rarely wrote anything for his
own paper. His custom was to go to the case and put
his articles in type as he composed them. Few can realize
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
the difficulties occasioned by the dual processes of
thought thus brought into play. Local news is the life
of all newspapers in young communities. This he could
not purvey, nor was his business management a success.</p>

<p>Thaddeus Hanford, the eldest of the brothers of that
name, in his early boyhood showed ability as a writer
and after he had passed through college with honor he
returned to Seattle and engaged in newspaper work. For
a year or more he was the owner of the <i>Intelligencer</i>, but
sold it about 1879 as is noted elsewhere.</p>

<p>One of the most widely known as well as popular of
the old-time newspaper men was E. T. Gunn. He worked
in the <i>Oregonian</i> office as early as 1851 and was one of
its owners for a time. In 1855 he was engaged in newspaper
work at Steilacoom. November 30, 1867, he started
the <i>Olympia Transcript</i> and its publication was continued
regularly until his death in 1883. The <i>Transcript</i> was
the neatest and best-printed of all the early papers and
for many years exerted much influence in political affairs
of the territory. A split in the Republican party occurred
in 1867 and was the cause of the <i>Transcript</i> being started,
and for about six years while this schism continued it
championed the cause of the "bolting wing" of the party.
In 1872 an alliance between the bolters and the Democrats
resulted in the overwhelming triumph of the fusion
party, Judge O. B. McFadden being elected to Congress
over Selucius Garfield, the Republican candidate. All
the newspapers in Olympia were in sympathy with the
fusionists, and this led to the organization of a company
which established the <i>Puget Sound Courier</i>.</p>

<p>This company was under the leadership of Elisha P.
Ferry, then Surveyor-General, who became Territorial
Governor in 1873, and the first Governor of the State of
Washington in 1889.</p>

<p>The <i>Daily Courier</i> made its first appearance January 2,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
1872, and the weekly later in the week. During that
year H. G. Struve, then practicing his profession in
Olympia, did much editorial work, while the late Fred
Prosch had charge of the mechanical department. In
December C. B. Bagley became business manager and
city editor, and in June, 1873, he bought the office and
newspaper. The daily was discontinued at the close of
1874. Mr. Bagley was appointed Territorial Printer in
1873, and held that position for ten years. He continued
the <i>Weekly Courier</i> until late in 1884, when he sold out
to Thomas H. Cavanaugh, who changed the name of the
paper to the <i>Partisan</i>.</p>

<p>During the period between 1873 and 1883 Olympia had
four weekly newspapers most of the time, while several
small dailies appeared from time to time, but never for
more than a few months. Until the Seattle papers began
to take telegraphic dispatches the Olympia papers had
most of their circulation at Seattle and points further
down Sound, but this gradually ceased, and long before
the admission of the state their patronage had become
almost wholly local in character.</p>

<p>Steilacoom, until about 1880, when Tacoma began its
second growth, was a favorite field for newspaper ventures.
Mr. Charles Prosch held the field there nearly six
years, much longer than anyone else, and while some of
his early contemporaries manifested more vigor and belligerency
in their editorial columns, none of them gave
so much local news or possessed one half the literary merit
of the <i>Herald</i>.</p>

<p>Francis H. Cook also moved from Olympia to Tacoma,
with a newspaper plant, on which he had for a time published
the <i>Echo</i>. This paper was started in 1868 by Randall
H. Hewitt, and that year in its office the writer began
work as a printer. James E. Whitworth, now of Seattle,
Nathan S. Porter, of Olympia, and Ike M. Hall worked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
together in that office. Hundreds of the older residents
of Seattle remember Judge Hall, who died here about ten
years ago. Early in 1869 C. B. Bagley became the owner
and publisher of the <i>Echo</i> for about a year. Like most
of its fellows, it underwent all manner of changes of ownership,
of form and place of publication during an erratic
career of about eight years.</p>

<p>During the eight or ten years following the founding of
Tacoma in 1873, many attempts were made to establish
newspapers there, but most of them were far from profitable
to their backers. In fact, it has been frequently reported
that their more pretentious successors have not
been far from financial stress.</p>

<p>The <i>Beacon</i> was brought from Kalama by Mr. and Mrs.
Mooney, which had been the organ of the Northern Pacific
Railroad. This soon died. In 1880 there started
the <i>North Pacific Coast</i>, but its life was brief.</p>

<p>R. F. Radebaugh, of San Francisco, and H. C. Patrick,
of Sacramento, came to Tacoma and started the <i>Weekly
Ledger</i> April 23, 1880. April 7, 1883, the <i>Daily Ledger</i>
was started, and both the weekly and daily are still appearing
regularly, having long passed the usual period
that has been fatal to so many papers on Puget Sound.</p>

<p>Mr. Patrick left the <i>Ledger</i> in 1882 and bought the <i>Pierce
County News</i>, which had been started August 10, 1881,
by George W. Mattice. Mr. Patrick changed the name
to <i>Tacoma News</i>, and it appeared as a weekly paper until
September 15, 1883, when he started the <i>Daily News</i>. It
continues to occupy the evening field, while the <i>Ledger</i> retains
the morning field.</p>

<p>The limits of this article do not permit mention of
many papers which have appeared from time to time in
every town and almost every village. In the writer's
collection there are not less than one hundred publications,
daily, weekly, or monthly, that have sprung into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
life since 1852. Most of them are forgotten in the communities
where they appeared. Success has come to but
here and there one.</p>

<p>Kirk C. Ward was a fluent writer and a promoter of no
small sagacity. Having lost control of the <i>Post</i>, he soon
induced some friends to back him and started the <i>Chronicle</i>.
It had a variegated career and finally became the
property of one of the leading law firms of the city, McNaught,
Ferry, McNaught &amp; Mitchell. They employed
a Bohemian from Kansas, named Frank C. Montgomery,
as editor, who conducted it until May 1, 1886, when
Homer M. Hill, who is now engaged in other business
in Seattle, bought it.</p>

<p>The Hall brothers were conducting the <i>Call</i> and the
two papers were consolidated, and on Monday, May 3,
1886, the paper came out with Vol. 1, No. 1 of the Seattle
<i>Daily Press</i>. A weekly paper was also run in connection
with the daily. Mr. Hill ere long acquired the entire
ownership of the paper. He was a shrewd, capable business
man of untiring industry, and under his management
the paper became a valuable property. Interests
in it had been sold and bought back from time to time,
and at the time Mr. Hill closed out his ownership Harry
White held some of its shares. At that time the paper
was absolutely free from debt and had a good bank account
and was making money for its owners.</p>

<p>Mr. W. E. Bailey, a wealthy young man from Philadelphia,
had large interests here, and he became the victim
to an ambition to conduct a big newspaper. Under
these circumstances Mr. Hill had no difficulty in getting
his price for the <i>Press</i>. Mr. L. S. J. Hunt of the <i>Post-Intelligencer</i>
conducted the negotiations and made the purchase
and at once transferred the property to Mr. Bailey.
He made important additions to the mechanical department
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
and engaged a large news and editorial force, whose
chief instructions were to make a clean, live newspaper.</p>

<p>At the time Mr. Hill bought the <i>Chronicle</i> it owned the
Associated Press evening franchise, which was its most
valuable asset.</p>

<p>In passing, it is proper to note the fact that the present
<i>Times</i> is the lineal successor of the <i>Chronicle</i>, and while
for a brief period there was a break in the legal succession,
it may be truthfully said that the historical succession
to the Associated Press franchise is derived from the
<i>Chronicle</i> down through the <i>Press</i> and the <i>Press-Times</i> to
<i>The Times</i> of to-day.</p>

<p>The consolidation of the <i>Chronicle</i> and <i>Call</i> threw a lot
of printers and newspaper men out of employment, including
Thomas H. Dempsey, the foreman of the <i>Chronicle</i>
office. The latter was a keen business man and a
competent printer. He and the late Col. George G. Lyon
and James P. Ferry at once organized a new company,
and secured a printing outfit that served their purpose
temporarily. The same day, May 3, 1886, that the <i>Press</i>
was issued, No. 1, Vol. 1 of the <i>Daily Times</i> also appeared.
Seattle, then a little city of about 10,000 population,
was thus the proud possessor of three daily
papers.</p>

<p>The starting of these two papers just preceded the
"boom" in Seattle real estate, when the volume of advertising
was vastly increased as well as population of
the city, and both papers made money rapidly.</p>

<p>February 10, 1891, Mr. Bailey bought the <i>Times</i> from
Lyon and Dempsey, paying for it $48,000. He had paid
somewhere from $20,000 to $25,000 for the <i>Press</i>. He
consolidated the two under the name of the <i>Press-Times</i>.</p>

<p>The period of financial depression which followed a
couple of years later bore heavily upon Mr. Bailey and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
and he was finally compelled to give up the paper to his
creditors, having lost not less than $200,000 during his
journalistic career.</p>

<p>The history of its subsequent vicissitudes and difficulties
would fill a volume, but can be touched upon but
briefly here. The paper was on the market for a long
time. John Collins had it for a time and sunk a lot of
money in it, having acquired it through a mortgage of
$15,000. John W. Pratt, whose recent lamented death
is fresh in the memories of a host of friends, secured control
of it for a time. At times it was published by a receiver.
Hughes and Davies came into possession of it
through ex-Sheriff James Woolery, who had taken it over
under the mortgage given to John Collins.</p>

<p>During this troubled period among other happenings
the name was changed back to <i>The Times</i>, and also the
Associated Press franchise was surrendered and that of
the United Service taken over. Later, and subsequent
to the mortgage of $15,000 given to John Collins, the
Associated Press franchise was again secured, and this
was a vital point in the legal contest that arose, The Times
Printing Company, headed by Col. A. J. Blethen on one
side, and Hughes &amp; Davies on the other.</p>

<p>Colonel Blethen bought <i>The Times</i> August 7, 1897, and
his first editorial appeared in it three days later. He
came well equipped for newspaper work and management
by reason of wide experience in other fields, and
month by month he and his sons, Joseph and Clarence B.,
have made it better and better, and to-day is one of the
most valuable newspaper properties on the Pacific Coast
and one of the great dailies of the United States.</p>

<h3>IN MEMORIAM OF WILLARD H. REES.</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span></p>

<p>It is a labor of love to say that when the writer first
met W. H. Rees in 1844, the latter was, for a man in his
twenty-fifth year, in advance of his general surroundings.
His intelligence and manner of telling what he knew on
any subject drew men near his own age to him strongly.
There were, I found on riper acquaintance, family reasons
for part of this. His father (then a citizen of Hamilton
County, Ohio), had been a member of the legislature of
his native state of Delaware, and his mother had a place
in the <i>literati</i> of her day. The father was of Welsh stock,
and judging by the son, an active, ardent member of the
Whig party at the time. Willard and I were thrown
together in the tide of emigration setting out from Saint
Louis towards the rendezvous of proposed emigrants to
Oregon. The boat we were on landed at Weston, and
from thence we hired a team belonging to other emigrants to
haul our effects, and we walked to Saint Joseph. From
thence Rees and I footed it ten miles higher up the Missouri
to the camp of the emigrants under Gilliam's leadership.
Learning there that a man living but three miles
off needed two assistants to get his family and effects to
Oregon, we were at his residence next morning as he rose
from breakfast, and within five minutes were engaged
to come to Oregon with him as his assistants. Within
twenty-five minutes, mounted on a good horse, with gold
coin to purchase breadstuffs for ten persons for three
months' journey, Rees was on his way back to Saint
Joe. He and I then began a year of such intimate relations
to each other as leads me to say Capt. R. W. Morrison,
our employer, made no mistake in trusting Mr.
Rees with the most important acts in conducting his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
preparations for the journey to Oregon. When we effected
a military organization for the trip, no mistake was made
in the election of Rees as first sergeant, with the duties
of adjutant. And when, after arrival in Oregon, fifteen
of us near the same age were employed logging and running
Hunt's saw mill, on the Lower Columbia, Rees was
easily our leader. Leaving that in June, 1845, and coming
to Oregon City to vote, he still, without effort on his
part, was by common consent in the first place. There
were at Oregon City two young men I might claim as his
peers at that date&mdash;Charles E. Pickett and J. W. Nesmith.
It was the former and Rees, I believe, who led to
the formation of the first literary association. Mr.
Pickett was at that time reader from the public news box.
The contents were volunteer contributions, each writer
choosing his subject, and of course extending from harmless
fun to the most serious questions. This suggested
the formation of the literary society, naturally.</p>

<p>J. W. Nesmith stood among the young men of 1843
immigration to Oregon as W. H. Rees stood among those
of 1844. Both observers and helpers in the history being
made, the former watching and participating personally
in almost every forward movement, the latter wielding
perhaps a greater personal influence, but manifesting no
ambition for personal advancement. Mr. Rees worked
as a carpenter at Oregon City from June, 1845, to June,
1846 (the exact dates are not remembered), but between
these dates had purchased a claim in the northern portion
of Champoeg, [Marion] County. At the finishing
of Doctor McLoughlin's flouring mill he with other American
mechanics celebrated the occasion with a ball, which
was attended by most of the leading people of parties
having interest in the Oregon Boundary Question. Lieut.
Wm. Peel was there using his tongue, eyes and ears, we
may suppose, to give reliable information in regard to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
Americans in Oregon to his father, then premier of the
British Government. Lieutenant Peel was of the British
navy, but not of the <i>Modeste</i> whose officers generally
were in company with him when mingling with Americans
as on this occasion. There was no dancing going
on. It was a time of social relaxation. Doctor Newell,
a Rocky Mountain doctor, and a man of sterling good
sense, had been giving his opinion of some of Peel's social
behavior as not such as was beyond criticism among
Americans. Peel replied, "Well, Doctor, Americans believe
in the rule of majorities, and I think the British
are in a majority here." Mr. Newell thought not. A
Britisher will settle any question by a bet, and Mr. Peel
offered the bet of a bottle of wine that a majority of those
then present were for the British side of the Oregon
Boundary Question. Doctor Newell took the bet. A
count was made and Mr. Newell won. Peel on this,
looking at a man across the mill floor, offered another
bottle on that particular man fighting for the British
side in the contingency of war over Oregon. William
Penland, an Englishman, put the question: "Sir, which
flag would you support in the event of war over Oregon?"
Rees replied, "I fight under the Stars and Stripes, sir."
Mr. Rees, no matter what his garb, was always comparatively
neat, and might well be taken for a middle class
Welshman.</p>

<p>Newell and he already neighbors, from this time forward
had a potent influence among the French-Canadian
farmers. Both were admirers of Doctor McLoughlin, and
Rees' influence was greatly enhanced by his taking the
finishing of the Catholic Church at Saint Louis, and by
writing brief tributes to their lives as they passed to the
other side. From his genial social nature it was easy for
Mr. Rees to give these retired engagees of the Hudson
Bay Company information as to what these newly formed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
relations to the United States Government required of
them, in which he was aided by neighbors and friends&mdash;Doctor
Newell and F. X. Mathieu. It was his pleasure
and pastime to learn of the later life, death and burial in
the French settlement of two of the gallant band, Philip
Degrett and Francis Rivet, [The authoritative lists of the
Lewis and Clark Company does not contain these two
names.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>] who followed the lead of Lewis and Clark
from the sources of the Columbia to the ocean in 1805,
and to give to the historian a transcript of the first Catholic
parish registry, including the names and ages of Gervais,
Lucier, Cannon, Labonte, and Dubruil, who came with
Hunt in 1811.</p>

<p>In 1847 Mr. Rees was elected as a colleague of his friend
Dr. Newell. Wm. H. Rector, A. Chamberlain and Anderson
Cox being the other members representing Champoeg
County in the lower house of the Oregon legislature.
From the foregoing causes and his steady patriotism Mr.
Rees became a potent influence in sending young men
from the French settlement to the fighting field in the
Cayuse country on the Whitman massacre, himself going
as regimental commissary agent.</p>

<p>As the troops were retiring from the Cayuse country,
gold was discovered in California and many of the soldiers
were amongst the first to go to the mines, Willard
H. Rees of the number. A larger proportion of the
French half-breeds never returned than of the Americans,
and from 1849 the Canadian settlement began to disintegrate.
As the pioneer settlement died, Rees's ready pen
gave them kindly notice. In the period between 1850
and 1860 he was watchful and active, but never for himself;
being of Whig antecedents it was natural for him
to help in the formation of the Union party, and that he
did; also, being a leader in the formation of the Pioneer
Association, the pages of its annual publications will furnish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
the future historical gleaner many valuable points
there inserted by the pen of Willard H. Rees.</p>

<p>The death of his body at 83 years is not reasonable
cause of mourning; his nearest friends have had cause
for sadness in the slow and gradual mental decay which
was perceptible to them for many years before the final
end. A change, slight and unperceived by ordinary observers,
was noted by his intimate friends as far back as
1879, when a few lines in the annual address to the pioneers
prepared by him but which he was unable to attend
and deliver, and were well read by F. M. Bewley, seemed
unlike the Rees of 1859. Yet in that address he characteristically
goes to the very beginning of social free
and easy interchange of personal views on the life of the
times of 1845-6. This early social life expressed itself
through an organization called the Pioneer Lyceum and
Literary Club, and he thus speaks of it: "The following
are the names Charlie Pickett had on the membership roll.
They were at times widely scattered and are designated
upon the roll as regular and visiting members:</p>

<p>"John H. Couch, F. W. Pettygrove, J. M. Woir, A. L.
Lovejoy, J. Applegate, S. W. Moss, Robert Newell, J. W.
Nesmith, Ed Otie, H. A. G. Lee, F. Prigg, C. E. Pickett,
Wm. C. Dement, Medorum Crawford, Hiram Strait,
J. Wambaugh, Wm. Cushing, Philip Foster, Ransom
Clark, H. H. Hide (Hyde?), John G. Campbell, Top
McGruder, W. H. Rees, Mark Ford, Henry Saffren,
Noyes Smith, Daniel Waldo, P. G. Stewart, Isaac W.
Smith, Joseph Watt, Frank Ematinger, A. E. Wilson,
Jacob Hoover, S. M. Holderness, John Minto, Barton
Lee, General Husted, and John P. Brooks.</p>

<p>"Perhaps a more congenial, easy-going, self-satisfying
club has never since congregated in the old capital city
and under changed condition of affairs, especially in
fashions so strikingly different from the unique and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
richly colored costumes of that day, never will the good
people of our spray-bedewed old city rest upon the like
again." The names are given as history, the last quotation
as a sample of Mr. Rees's quiet humor.</p>

<p>Now an end of life by natural law is not a proper
subject of mourning. Willard H. Rees did not so regard
it, when his generous kindness led him to collect the
most praiseworthy incidents of very earliest and most
unlettered of the pioneers from those coming with Lewis
and Clark and Astor's enterprise to those better informed
who came after he himself was here. The contributions
of Willard H. Rees, J. W. Nesmith, and M. P. Deady to
the Oregon Pioneer Association publication would alone
constitute no mean volume of the history of Oregon, beginning
with retired Canadian hunters and trappers who
by cultivating the soil of Oregon and creating a magazine
of supplies to the American homebuilders unawares were
cultivating the seeds of civilization aided and foreseen by
the Applegates, Burnetts, Waldos, Nesmiths, Rees, and
others who managed a bloodless victory over the pro-British
occupation of Oregon.</p>

<h3>SHORT BIOGRAPHY OF JOSEPH
HOLMAN.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span></p>

<p>Joseph Holman was born at Little Torrington, Devonshire,
England, August 20, 1815. His parents were
John and Elizabeth Holman. His father was a mechanic,
and manufacturer of agricultural implements,
and died when Joseph was quite young, leaving two
older sons. The eldest son carried on his father's business,
the younger brothers living with him to learn the
trade.</p>

<p>When Joseph was sixteen years of age, the second
brother emigrated to Canada and sent such good reports
of large wages for mechanics that when Joseph was eighteen
his elder brother allowed him to follow, though bound
to him until twenty-one. In 1833 Joseph took passage on
the ship "Eliza" for Canada and landed at Prince Edward's
Island where the ship was seized for debt, which
detained the passengers some weeks, the creditors furnishing
codfish and potatoes only, for food. The ship
finally sailed for Quebec and to London, in Canada, where
Joseph found his brother, and worked in that place for
several years, but disliked the rough ways of that early
time. He went alone to New Lisbon, Ohio, where he
worked at wagon making for a year. Hearing much of
the so-called West at that time, he went to Peoria, Illinois,
found work and lived two years there. During that
time, Jason Lee, on his way from Oregon to the East,
stopped at Peoria and lectured on Oregon. In the spring
of 1839 eighteen persons agreed to go to Oregon and
settle there. Joseph Holman had ideas of a large city
at the mouth of the Columbia River, and he wanted to be
one to help take the claim. The party started west with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
horses and wagons. At Independence, Missouri, they
sold the wagons and bought mules to carry packs. Mr.
Farnham was chosen captain. They traveled to Bent's
Fort on the Arkansas River without mishap, and to
Bent's Fort on the Platte River [generally called St.
Vrain's] became demoralized. Some went back, Mr.
Farnham went to Santa Fé, others went through the
next year, but Joseph Holman, with Cook, Fletcher and
Kilbourn, determined to go to Oregon. While away from
the fort to get dry buffalo meat for food the Indians stole
their horses. They worked at the fort until they earned
more horses, and late in the fall the four started alone
and reached Green River, in the Rocky Mountains, and
camped in a sheltered place called "Brown's Hole," also
Joe Meek, Doctor Newell, Cary and others. Joseph Holman's
mechanical knowledge helped him here, for he
stocked guns, made saddles for Indians, and received an
extra horse and beaver skins (as good as money) in return.
Doctor Newell decided to start early in the spring,
with the beaver skins to Fort Hall, in Idaho, to avoid
Indian war parties who would be out later on. They
were caught in the snow and nearly perished. Where
Doctor Newell expected to see buffalo they did not see
one. They were four days without any food, until they
met a Digger Indian woman who sold them her two dogs.
After that they now and then killed an antelope until
they reached Fort Hall where they remained three weeks
to recuperate themselves and horses. Doctor Newell
remained here. The four young men left with a Hudson
Bay agent for Fort Boise, but went alone from there to
Walla Walla, arriving there May 1, 1840; from there down
the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver, was the hardest
part of the trip, especially from The Dalles to Fort Vancouver,
on the north side of the Columbia. The water was
high at that season of the year, had covered the Indian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
trail on the bank of the river, and they were obliged to
lead their ponies over the bluffs to Fort Vancouver, a
fact Doctor McLaughlin could hardly believe when they
arrived, at 11 o'clock June 1, 1840. In the afternoon of
the same day a ship arrived at Fort Vancouver from New
York, with forty Methodist missionaries to teach and convert
the Indians. A Miss Almira Phelps, from Springfield,
Massachusetts, was one, to whom Joseph was married
in less than a year. He was twenty-six years of age,
and even then showed a progressive spirit. The four, Mr.
Cooke, Mr. Fletcher, Mr. Kilbourn, and Joseph Holman,
rode around looking for places to settle. They took up
land and built a cabin. The Methodist mission employed
them for a time and paid them in stock.</p>

<p>Joseph Holman cut the first stick of timber on the
present town site of Salem, and just back of the asylum
for the insane he took up his claim of land, which was
a mile square. He rode a horse to the east, to the north,
to the west, to the south, and staked it. Years afterward
surveyors said he surveyed it correctly on his horse, a
mile square. Mrs. John H. Albert, now living, was born
on this land, Joseph Holman's eldest daughter. His only
son, George Phelps Holman, was the first white child
born in Salem, or the county.</p>

<p>Joseph Holman's heart and soul were for Oregon, for its
building up, its prosperity. His loyalty was unbounded.
He was honest, affectionate, and true.</p>

<p class="p2">This short statement was dictated by Mr Joseph Holman
to his wife during his last illness in 1880. He was
on a lounge, and told these facts, and she penciled them
down and copied them June 27, 1902, in the present
form.</p>

of the Columbia, and the state of the fur trade, as carried on by the citizens of
the United States and the Hudson's Bay Company," as shown in the communications
of Gen. W. H. Ashley, Joshua Pilcher, J. D. Smith, David E. Jackson,
and W. L. Sublette, and William Clark and Lewis Cass.</p>

<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap">St. Louis</span>, October 29, 1830.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: The business commenced by General Ashley some years ago,
of taking furs from the United States territory beyond the Rocky
Mountains has since been continued by Jedediah S. Smith, David
E. Jackson, and William L. Sublette, under the firm of Smith,
Jackson, and Sublette. They commenced business in 1826, and have
since continued it, and have made observations and gained information
which they think it important to communicate to the government.
The number of men they have employed has usually been from eighty
to one hundred and eighty; and with these, divided into parties, they
have traversed every part of the country west of the Rocky Mountains,
from the peninsula of California to the mouth of the Columbia River.
Pack horses, or rather mules, were at first used, but in the beginning
of the present year, it was determined to try wagons, and in the month
of April last, on the 10th day of the month, a caravan of ten wagons,
drawn by five mules each, and two dearborns, drawn by one mule
each, set out from St. Louis. We have eighty-one men in company,
all mounted on mules, and these were exclusive of a party left in the
mountains. Our route from St. Louis was nearly due west to the
western limits of the state and thence along the Santa Fé trail about
forty miles, from which the course was some degrees north of west,
across the waters of the Kanzas, and up the Great Platte River, to the
Rocky Mountains, and to the head of Wind River, where it issues from
the mountains. This took us until the 16th of July, and was as far as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
wished the wagons to go, as the furs to be brought in were to be collected
at this place, which is, or was this year, the great rendezvous of
the persons engaged in that business. Here the wagons could easily
have crossed the Rocky Mountains, it being what is called the Southern
[South] Pass, had it been desirable for them to do so, which it was not
for the reason stated. For our support, at leaving the Missouri settlements,
until we should get into the buffalo country, we drove twelve
head of cattle, beside a milk cow. Eight of these only being required
for use before we got to the buffaloes, the others went on to the head
of Wind River. We began to fall in with the buffaloes on the Platte,
about three hundred and fifty miles from the white settlements, and
from that time lived on buffaloes, the quantity being infinitely beyond
what we needed. On the fourth of August, the wagons being in the
meantime loaded with furs which had been previously taken, we set
out on the return to St. Louis. All the high points of the mountains
then in view were white with snow, but the passes and valleys, and all
the level country, were green with grass. Our route back was over
the same ground nearly as in going out, and we arrived at St. Louis
on the 10th of October, bringing back the ten wagons, the dearborns
being left behind; four of the oxen and the milk cow were also
brought back to the settlements in Missouri, as we did not need them
for provision. Our men were all healthy during the whole time, we
suffered nothing by the Indians, and had no accident but the death of
one man, being buried under a bank of earth that fell in upon him, and
another being crippled at the same time. Of the mules, we lost but
one by fatigue, and two horses stolen by the Kanzas Indians; the grass
being, along the whole route going and coming, sufficient for the support
of the horses and mules. The usual weight in the wagons was
about one thousand eight hundred pounds. The usual progress of the
wagons was from fifteen to twenty-five miles per day. The country
being almost all open, level, and prairie, the chief obstructions were
ravines and creeks, the banks of which required cutting down, and for
this purpose a few pioneers were generally kept ahead of the caravan.
This is the first time that wagons ever went to the Rocky Mountains,
and the ease and safety with which it was done prove the facility of
communicating overland with the Pacific Ocean. The route from the
Southern Pass, where the wagons stopped, to the Great Falls of the
Columbia, being easier and better than on this side of the mountains,
with grass enough for horses and mules, but a scarcity of game for the
support of men. One of the undersigned, to wit, Jedediah S. Smith,
in his excursion west of the mountains, arrived at the post of the Hudson's
Bay Company, called Fort Vancouver, near the mouth of Multnomah
River. He arrived there in August, 1828, and left the 12th of
March, 1829, and made observations which he deems it material to
communicate to the government. Fort Vancouver is situated on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
north side of the Columbia, five miles above the mouth of the Multnomah,
in a handsome prairie, and on a second bank about three quarters
of a mile from the river. This is the fort as it stood when he arrived
there; but a large one, three hundred feet square about three quarters
of a mile lower down, and within two hundred yards of the river, was
commenced the spring he came away. Twelve pounders were the
heaviest cannon which he saw. The crop of 1828 was seven hundred
bushels of wheat, the grain full and plump, and making good flour,
fourteen acres of corn, the same number of acres in peas, eight acres
of oats, four or five acres of barley, a fine garden, some small apple
trees, and grape vines. The ensuing spring eighty bushels of seed
wheat were sown. About two hundred head of cattle, fifty horses and
breeding mares, three hundred head of hogs, fourteen goats, the usual
domestic fowls. They have mechanics of various kinds, to wit, blacksmiths,
gunsmiths, carpenters, coopers, tinner, and baker. A good
saw mill on the bank of the river five miles above, a grist mill worked
by hand, but intended to work by water. They had built two coasting
vessels, one of which was then on a voyage to the Sandwich Islands.
No English or white woman was at the fort, but a great number of
mixed blood Indian extraction, such as belong to the British fur trading
establishments, who were treated as wives, and the families of
children taken care of accordingly. So that everything seemed to
combine to prove that this fort was to be a permanent establishment.
At Fort Vancouver the goods for the Indian trade are imported from
London, and enter the territories of the United States paying no
duties, and from the same point the furs taken on the other side of the
mountains are shipped. The annual quantity of these furs could not
be exactly ascertained, but Mr. Smith was informed indirectly that
they amounted to about thirty thousand beaver skins, besides otter
skins and small furs. The beaver skins alone, at New York prices,
would be worth above two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. To
obtain these furs, both trapping and trading are resorted to. Various
parties, provided with traps, spread over the country south of the Columbia
to the neighborhood of the Mexican territory, and in 1824 and
1825 they crossed the Rocky Mountains and trapped on the waters of
the Missouri River. They do not trap north of latitude 49 degrees,
but confine that business to the territory of the United States. Thus
this territory, being trapped by both parties, is nearly exhausted of
beavers, and unless the British can be stopped, will soon be entirely
exhausted, and no place left within the United States where beaver
fur in any quantity can be obtained.</p>

<p>The inequality of the convention with Great Britain in 1818 is most
glaring and apparent, and its continuance is a great and manifest injury
to the United States. The privileges granted by it have enabled
the British to take possession of the Columbia River, and spread over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
the country south of it; while no Americans have ever gone, or can
venture to go on the British side. The interest of the United States
and her citizens engaged in the fur trade requires that the convention
of 1818 should be terminated, and each nation confined to its own territories.
By this commercial interest there are other considerations
requiring the same result. These are, the influence which the British
have already acquired over the Indians in that quarter, and the
prospect of a British colony, and a military and naval station on the
Columbia. Their influence over the Indians is now decisive. Of this
the Americans have constant and striking proofs, in the preference
which they give to the British in every particular.</p>

<p>In saying this, it is an act of justice to say, also, that the treatment
received by Mr. Smith at Fort Vancouver was kind and hospitable;
that, personally, he owes thanks to Governor Simpson and the gentlemen
of the Hudson's Bay Company, for the hospitable entertainment
which he received from them, and for the efficient and successful aid
which they gave him in recovering from the Umquah Indians a quantity
of fur and many horses, of which these Indians had robbed him
in 1828.</p>

<p>As to the injury which must happen to the United States from the
British getting the control of all the Indians beyond the mountains,
building and repairing ships in the tide water region of the Columbia,
and having a station there for their privateers and vessels of war, is
too obvious to need a recapitulation. The object of this communication
being to state <i>facts</i> to the Government, and to show the facility
of crossing the continent to the Great Falls of the Columbia with
wagons, the ease of supporting any number of men by driving cattle
to supply them where there was no buffalo, and also to show the true
nature of the British establishments on the Columbia, and the unequal
operation of the convention of 1818.</p>

<p>These <i>facts</i> being communicated to the Government, they consider
that they have complied with their duty, and rendered an acceptable
service to the administration; and respectfully request you, sir, to lay
it before President Jackson.</p>

<p>We have the honor to be sir, yours, respectfully,</p>

<p class="center">OREGON, THE NEW ELDORADO.</p>

<p>We derive from a long letter in the <i>National Intelligencer</i> the following
sketch of the Territory beyond the Rocky Mts., which is now
the theme of debate in the U. S. Senate.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Newark Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>"Within a few years several Americans, of whom the writer is one,
have crossed the Rocky Mts., to the mouth of the Columbia, with objects
entirely unconnected with trade or commerce. Mine was a desire
to see a new country, a love of adventure for its own sake, and an
enthusiastic fondness for natural history. The party with which I
traveled left Independence, Mo., about the latter part of April, 1834,
and arrived at the British Fort, Vancouver, in September, having
performed the whole journey on horseback. From this time until October,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
1836, with the exception of the first winter which I passed at
the Sandwich Islands, my residence was in the Territory of Oregon.
Dr. McLoughlin, chief factor, treated me with uniform and singular
kindness, supplying all my wants and furnishing me with every facility
in the prosecution of my plans. This is, I believe, the uniform
character of the Superintendents of British forts in that country.
Travelers, naturalists, and all who are not traders are kindly and hospitably
treated, but the moment a visitor is known to trade a beaver
skin from an Indian, that moment he is ejected from the community.
The company has a sum of money amounting to several thousand
pounds sterling, laid aside at Vancouver for the sole purpose of opposing
all who may come to interfere with its monopoly, by purchasing
at exhorbitant prices all the furs in possession of the Indians, and thus
forcing the settler to come to terms or driving him from the country.
If it be an individual who is thus starved into submission he then
usually clears a piece of land on the Willamette River, takes an Indian
wife, and purchases furs of the natives, which, by previous contract,
he is bound to sell to the company at an advance which is fixed
by the governor.</p>

<p>Ft. Vancouver, the principal trading post of the Oregon, stands on
the north bank of the river, about 90 miles from the mouth. The fort
consists of several dwellings, storehouses, workshops, etc., all of frame
arranged together in quadrilateral form, and surrounded by a stockade
of pine logs about 20 ft. high. The Ft. has no bastions, and contains
no armament. There are, to be sure, 4 great guns frowning in
front of the governor's mansion, 2 long 18s and 2 9-pounders, but two
of them have long been spiked and the others are unfit for service.</p>

<p>The rainy season begins here about the middle of October and continues
until the first of April. During this period the weather is almost
uniformly dull, foggy, or rainy. Sometimes rain falls incessantly
for the space of 2 or 3 weeks. Occasionally, during the winter months,
there will be a light fall of snow, and in the winter of 1835-6 the river
was frozen over. The intensity of cold, however, continued but a few
days and was said to be very unusual. The general range of the thermometer,
(Fahr.) during that season was from 36-48 degrees, but for
3 or 4 days was as low as 25 degrees.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Ft. Vancouver, the cattle graze during the whole
winter; no stabling or stall feeding is ever requisite, as the extensive
plains produce the finest and most abundant crops of excellent prairie
grass. In choosing a site for settlement on the main river, it is always
necessary to bear in mind the periodical inundations. Ft. Vancouver
itself, though built on a high piece of land at a distance of 600 yards
from the common rise of the tides, is sometimes almost reached by the
freshets of early spring. The soil here, on both sides of the river is
a rich black loam, the base being basaltic rock.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span></p>

<p>The face of the country from Ft. George, (Astoria,) to Vancouver,
a distance of 80 miles, is very much of a uniform character, consisting
of alluvial meadows, along the river-side, alternating with forests of
oak, pine, etc., while behind are extensive plains, some of which receive
estuaries of the river, while others are watered by lakes or
ponds. The pine forests are very extensive, the trees being of great
size, and the timber extraordinarily beautiful. All the timber of the
genus pinus is gigantic. I measured with Dr. Gairdner, surgeon of
the fort, a pine of the species <i>Douglass</i>, which had been prostrated by
the wind. Its height was above 200 ft., and its circumference 45 feet.
Large as was this specimen, its dimensions are much exceeded by one
measured by the late David Douglas. The height of this tree was
nearly 300 ft., and the circumference 56 ft. Cones of this pine, according
to Mr. D., were 12 to 15 inches long, resembling in size and
form sugar loaves. Oak timber of various kinds is abundant along
the river, as well as button wood, balsam, poplar, ash, sweet gum,
beech, and many other useful kinds, but no hickory or walnut. The
governor of Ft. Vancouver, who is an active agriculturist, has exerted
himself for several years in raising whatever appears adapted to the
soil. Wheat, rye, barley, pease, and culinary vegetables of all kinds
are raised in ample quantity. Fruits of various kinds, apples, peaches,
plums, etc., do remarkably well. I remember being particularly
struck, upon my arrival at Vancouver in the autumn, with the display
of apples in the garden of the fort. Trees were crowded with fruit,
so that every limb had to be sustained with a prop. Apples were literally
packed along the branches, and so closely that I could compare
them to nothing more aptly than ropes of onions. In the vicinity of
Walla Walla or the Ney [z] Perce's Fort, the country in every condition
for many miles exhibits an arid and cheerless prospect. The soil is
deep sand, and the plain upon which the fort stands produces nothing
but bushes of aromatic wormwood. Along the borders of the small
streams, however, the soil is exceedingly rich and productive, and on
these strips of land the superintendent raises his corn and the vegetables
necessary for the consumption of his people. The prong-horned
antelope occasionally ranged these plains; black-tailed or mule deer
is found in the vicinity; grouse of several species are very abundant,
and large prairie hare is common. In autumn and winter, in the vicinity
of Ft. Vancouver, ducks, geese, and swans swarm in immense
numbers. These are killed by the Indians and taken to the Ft. as articles
of trade. For a single duck, one load of powder and shot is
given; for a goose, 2; and for a swan, 4 loads. For deer 10 loads of ammunition,
or a bottle of rum is the usual price. Early in May salmon
are first seen entering the river, and the Columbia and all its tributaries
teem with these delicious fish. The Indians take great numbers
by various modes, subsisting almost wholly on them during their stay,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
and drying and packing them away in thatched huts to be used for
their winter store. Salmon also forms a chief article of food for the
inmates of the fort, and hundreds of casks are salted down every
season.</p>

<p>About 20 miles above this, in the Wallamet Valley, is the spot
chosen by the Methodist missionaries for their settlement, and here
also, a considerable number of retired servants of the company had
established themselves. The soil of this delightful valley is rich beyond
comparison, and the climate considerably milder than that of
Vancouver. Rain rarely falls, even in the winter season, but dews are
sufficiently heavy to compensate for its absence. The epidemic of the
country, ague, is rarely known here. In short, the Wallamet Valley
is a terrestrial paradise, to which I have known some to exhibit so
strong an attachment as to declare that notwithstanding the few privations
which must necessarily be experienced by settlers of a new
country, no consideration would ever induce them to return to their
former homes."</p>

<p class="left65">June 10, 1843.</p>

<p>The return of a company of mountain traders to the settlements
presents an opportunity for writing which I feel much inclined to embrace.
We are now between 2 and 300 miles west of Independence, on
the Blue river, a tributary of the Kansas, in good health and spirits.
I regret to say that a division has taken place in the company, in consequence
of the number of cattle driven by some, those having no
cattle refusing to stand guard over stock belonging to others. The
result of all this was that Capt. Burnett resigned command of the
company, and the commander, in accordance with our regulations,
ordered a new election, and so altered the by-laws that the commander
should be called colonel, and also authorized the election of 4 captains,
and 4 orderly sergeants. The cattle party selected myself as their candidate,
those opposed selected Mr. Wm. Martin, an experienced mountaineer.
There being a majority in opposition to the cattle party, Mr.
Martin was elected, and a division of the company ensued. About 50
wagons, with those who had large droves of loose cattle, now left, with
a general request that all in favor of traveling with them should fall
back. I was particularly solicited to leave Martin's party, but as it
would travel much the fastest, and Col. Martin was a very clever
fellow, I declined. The new company, it is expected, will be commanded
by Capt. Applegate. Our roads, since leaving the settlements
have been very fine, except within the last few days, during which
period they have been almost impassable in consequence of the tremendous
rains, but they are again improving. We have had no trouble
with the Indians, with the exception of horse and cattle stealing, and
this business they have carried on pretty lively. I had a very fine
mule and an ox stolen from me on the Kansas river, and we lost in all
some 8 or 10 head of horses and mules. I believe there is not a case of
sickness in camp, though old Mr. Stout, from Iowa, has a violent
swelling in his eyes. Tell the boys from Iowa to come on with all the
cattle and sheep they can get, and a company large enough to drive
them.</p>

<i>Republican</i>, Thursday, December 14, 1843.</p>

<p>We yesterday noticed a postscript of a letter from the Oregon country.
We have since seen letters from Lt. Fremont and other men of
his party, written at Ft. Hall, and bearing date of 20th September,
which do not confirm the report alluded to. The silence of these letters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
as to the surrender of Ft. Hall is full assurance to us that the report
is not correct. The letter before us, the statements of which are
corroborated by Lt. Fremont, himself, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I arrived at this place (Ft. Hall) on the 13th inst., with my part of
the caravan all safe and in tolerable order. * * * (Unimportant part
skipped). Lt. Fremont, whom I parted with on the South fork of the
Platte, and expected to meet at this place, joined us yesterday after
making a survey of the Salt Lake, which he has done much to his satisfaction.
The exploration and new routes which we have taken have
made our trip tedious and very laborious, but, I hope it will be satisfactory
to the Department. We leave tomorrow for the lower country,
and find it necessary to let some of our men off on account of the
scarcity of provisions, which are not to be had at this place. The full
objects of the expedition, will, I hope, be completed ere we return.
I shall leave the party in a few days for Walla Walla, or perhaps
lower down, to provide necessary supplies for the completion of the
business in that quarter. I can not say what time we will return to
St. Louis; it is to be hoped before the adjournment of Congress. The
emigrants passed this place some short time since, pretty well worn
down and scarce of food. The Indians on the Columbia are expected
to become troublesome to these newcomers. It is supposed they are
induced to acts of violence by some persons as yet unknown. They
have already burned Dr. Whitman's mill, and I fear it is not the last
spark which will be kindled in the settlement and occupation of this
country. The Hudson's Bay Company are improving and pushing
their business, perhaps with greater energy than usual, Dr. McLoughlin
is laying off towns on the Willamette, selling lots, etc. This is the
report, and you can see that the Dr. is in advance of Dr. Linn's bill."</p>

<p>The foregoing is the latest news from Oregon, and may be relied
upon as correct. Not the least interesting part of it is that which relates
to the disposition of the Indians towards the emigrants. We
have always believed that the Indians, backed and incited as they will
be by agents and emissaries of the Hudson's Bay Co., and furnished
as they doubtless will be, with arms and means of warfare from some
source, would oppose the emigrants in making their settlements. That
the country must be conquered before it is attained, we hardly
entertain a doubt, and if we did, the supineness of our Government
would only strengthen the belief. Why is it that our Government is
so indifferent to the claims of the nation upon this territory, its wealth
and possessions?</p>

St. Louis <i>Reveille</i>, Oct. 21, 1844.</p>

<p>The Platte <i>Argus</i> contains a letter from "Multnomah City," Oregon,
from which we make the following extracts. The killing of the Indian
has been briefly mentioned heretofore.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span></p>

<p>"When I first came here, 19 months ago, there were but 4 or 5
houses, now there is upwards of 80 good buildings, nearly all of two
stories, and 4 or 5 of three stories high. If there had been plenty of
nails we should have had a number more up. If a supply of nails
reaches us this spring, we shall have 200 houses before this reaches
you, and some of these of brick, for a company from Baltimore are now
building a brickyard. A tanyard is also being established. The fact
is, we have mechanics of all kinds here, though not a tenth of the
number of each kind required. The winter is past, but it was no
winter. It was rather a blooming spring, for we had but little rain
and no snow, and grass green all the time. We have had but two
days' rain in the last 45. I saw cattle yesterday which had run all
winter, in finer condition than I ever saw any in your state. Uncle
Sam had better be doing something for this country, for if not, within
three years <i>it will be too late</i>. You laugh, but if you live you will see
it. Therefore stir them up, Mac, for we do not want trouble here, and
would all rejoice if the star-spangled banner embraced us within its
ample folds. Our flag flying by authority would make a vast difference
here.</p>

<p>An Indian committed some outrages lately, and our sheriff endeavored
in vain to arrest him; then offered $100 reward for the Indian,
and went to his own house, 30 miles from this place. On Monday the
Indian came into Oregon City, close to Dr. McLoughlin's mill, where
some 25 or 30 men were at work. Winslow and some white men went
to take him, and got close to him. He saw Winslow, fired his gun,
which missed its mark, the ball lodging in a tree on this side of the
river within 2 feet of me, for I was at work at my garden at the time. The
Indian then fired his pistol, 2 balls from which lodged in the shoulder
of G. W. LeBreton, clerk of the court, tearing his arm dreadfully.
Mr. LeB. seized the Indian with the other hand, and then threw him
down. Winslow then ran up and knocked out his brains. In the
meantime, 5 other Indians fired their guns, and then their arrows,
and wounded two men."</p>

<p class="center"><i>Reveille</i>, November 4, 1844.</p>

<p class="center">NEWS FROM OREGON.</p>

<p>The <i>Western Expositor</i> of Saturday last announces the arrival of
Mr. Wm. Gilpin, formerly of this place, from Oregon. Mr. Gilpin
passed the winter among the American settlements of the Willamette
and the adjacent sea coast, and he describes them as enjoying prosperity
when he left them in April last. The emigrant party of '43,
which he accompanied, arrived at their destination in November last,
"after having braved and overcome unparalleled dangers and difficulties
from savages, from hunger, from thirst, crossing parched treeless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
plains, fierce angry rivers, and forcing their wagons through 1000
miles of mountains, declared impassable by the most experienced
guides and voyageurs."</p>

<p>This accession swelled the population of Oregon to upwards of 2000,
and they had formed a government, elected officers, established courts,
and a record of land titles. "Farms," he says, "freckle the magnificent
plains, towns are springing up at convenient points upon the
rivers, a dozen of excellent mills supply lumber and flour for home use
and export; the fisheries are not neglected, and lands are surveyed.
A college, numerous schools, and several churches are scattering education
amongst the young. Money has been sent from New York for
a printing press and steam engine, cattle and stock of all kinds are
accumulating and rapidly increasing under a mild climate and unfailing
pastures. Provisions of all kinds are abundant, of most excellent
quality and moderate prices."</p>

<p>Mr. Gilpin passed the trading fort of Bridger and Vasquez on the
19th of August. This fort is 100 miles west of Green River, and exactly
half way from Independence to the Willamette. The American
trappers scattered among the mountains had there collected to meet
the emigrants of last spring; an advanced party of 30 of whom, with
their wagons and cattle, passed on the 17th, two days later than the
emigrants of the preceding year. Two larger companies behind,
under the command of Gen. Gilliam and Col. Ford, passed subsequently,
and all in good time reached the settlements before the setting
in of winter.</p>

<i>Reveille</i>, January 20, 1845.</p>

<p class="center">OREGON.</p>

<p>We learn from a letter published in the <i>Weston Journal</i>, dated at
the Sandwich Islands, that the Oregon emigrants who went out during
the past season, have made great changes in business, money now
circulating, and everything begins to assume the appearance of the
civilization, business, trade, and refinements this side of the mountains.</p>
</div>

<hr class="l15" />

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<i>Republican</i>, February 8, 1848.</p>

<p class="center">OREGON.</p>

<p>We see it stated in up-country papers that the late arrivals from
Oregon furnished information that two parties of emigrants, dissatisfied
with their prospects in that country, attempted to return home
last winter, but were prevented by the difficulties of road and weather.
We have never entertained a doubt that this disposition was uppermost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
with all the best portions of the emigration to that region; but
obstacles are presented of such a character as to deter many persons
from attempting to return. Emigrants from the states find the greatest
difficulty in descending the mountain declivities into the valley of
the Columbia River, but then their wagons have been relieved of a
great part of the provisions and surplus weight, and they do get along.
If they should attempt to return to the United States, however, a different
prospect is presented. They must start amply provided with
provisions and everything necessary for the journey, and thus loaded
it has been deemed impossible to get wagons along over the mountains
which they necessarily have to ascend in their progress. This cause
alone has deterred many persons from making the attempt, and they
have been compelled to accommodate themselves to a country and a
condition of things in no respect better than they originally left. No
man, in our opinion, who has a comfortable home in any of the states
can be justified in giving it up in the expectation of bettering himself
in Oregon. If he has a family, he does a gross injustice to them in
exposing them to the hardships of so long and perilous a journey with
no prospect of returning to their friends, should they become discontented;
and even if an emigrant has nobody to care for but himself,
he had better stay at home and earn an honest living, than go to Oregon
and run the risk of working out a precarious one. For this reason
we have never countenanced any one for whom we had the least respect
in a journey to Oregon or California with a view to a fixed residence
there. Neither country presents half the inducements to be
found in any one of the Western states, and an adventure of this kind
is prima facie evidence of a restless and discontented spirit, not likely
to be pleased anywhere.</p>

<i>Republican</i>, May 19, 1848.</p>

<p>On the 20th of November the Governor appointed Columbia Lancaster
to be Supreme Judge of Oregon Territory, in place of J. Quinn
Thornton, resigned. From some proceedings of the legislature of a
subsequent period, we infer that Judge Thornton had left Oregon on
a visit to Washington City, as a sort of general agent, to attend to the
distribution of offices in the new territory. Of his arrival we have not
heard, and it is probable that Mr. Meek may reach Washington before
him.</p>

<p>[Then follows proceedings of legislature, resolutions, etc., intended
to keep J. Q. T. from leaving the territory, quoted in full. Also Governor's

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_41" id="Footnote_41" href="#FNanchor_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> The Ramage was so called because it was constructed by Adam Ramage, who
went to Philadelphia about 1790, and is believed to have been the first press builder
in America. For many years he constructed all the presses used in this country.
The posts and cross-pieces of the larger sizes of his early presses were made of
wood, and the bed, platen, tracks, springs, screw, lever, etc., of iron. The largest
Ramage press I ever saw had a bed 22x32 inches, with platen 16x22 inches. This
was used in printing the <i>Oregonian</i> for the first four months of its life, December,
1850, to April, 1851, and required four impressions to perfect a paper&mdash;an impression
for each page. Sixty to seventy perfect papers per hour was the limit of a
pressman's capacity. During the summer of 1853 a wooden extension was added
to the platen of the press by an Olympia (Wash.) mechanic, thus doubling its
capacity. The extra strain upon the muscles of the pressman as a result of this
enlargement caused the old machine to be dubbed a "man-killer."&mdash;<span class="smcap">George H.
